## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your System

### Text Editor

```
[CATCHY OPENING — 2-3 sentences that hook students into the phenomenon]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "[Component 1]" — [why it's external]
  ○ Click "[Component 2]" — [why it's external]
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "[Component 3]" — [why it's internal]
  ○ Click "[Component 4]" — [why it's internal]

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see [X] components on your canvas

STEP 3: ARRANGE YOUR MODEL
• Drag and drop components to organize them
• Put EXTERNAL components (orange) on the LEFT
• Put INTERNAL components (gray) on the RIGHT
• This shows cause → effect flow

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Transition sentence setting up Activity 2]
```

### Video Script

```
"[Opening hook — surprising fact or question, 2-3 sentences]

[Transition to building — 1-2 sentences]

Let's build our [system name]. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — these are orange. They're things we can't control.
[Examples specific to this lesson]

INTERNAL components — these are gray. They change BECAUSE of other things
in the system.

[Walk through each component with WHY it matters — 1-2 sentences each]

Hit the PLUS button to add each one to your model canvas.

Now drag them around. Put your external components on the left, internal
on the right. This shows the flow — outside forces affecting inside results.

[Closing transition — 2 sentences]

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
[HOOK — Why do these things connect? 1-2 sentences]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "[Component A]" and drag an arrow to "[Component B]"
• Click on "[Component B]" and drag an arrow to "[Component C]"
• [Additional connections as needed]

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/- toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ [Component A] → [Component B] = [POSITIVE/NEGATIVE] ([+/−])
    [Plain language explanation]

  ○ [Component B] → [Component C] = [POSITIVE/NEGATIVE] ([+/−])
    [Plain language explanation]

  ○ [Additional relationships]

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have [X] arrows total
• [X] negative relationships, [X] positive relationships

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Key insight — what pattern should students notice?]
```

### Video Script

```
"[Opening — why connections matter, 2-3 sentences]

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

[Walk through each connection with the key question format:]

First connection: Click on '[Component A]' and drag an arrow over to
'[Component B].' Here's the key question: When [A] goes UP, does [B]
go UP or DOWN?

[Explain the reasoning in plain language]

That's a [POSITIVE/NEGATIVE] relationship. Click the [plus/minus] sign.

[Continue for each relationship]

Look at your model now. [Describe the pattern they should see]

[Key insight about the system — 2-3 sentences]

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
[HOOK — Time to test it! 1-2 sentences]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When [Component A] is HIGH (100%), what happens to [Component B]?
• When [Component B] is [HIGH/LOW], what happens to [Component C]?

STEP 3: CHANGE A VARIABLE
• Look at the RIGHT PANEL where your components are listed
• Find the LOCK icon (🔒) next to "[Component A]"
• Click the lock to TURN [ON/OFF] [Component A] (set to [0/100]%)
• This simulates [what real-world scenario?]

STEP 4: WATCH THE CASCADE
• Resume the simulation
• What happens to [Component B] when [condition]?
• What happens to [Component C]?

STEP 5: TRY ANOTHER SCENARIO
• Lock "[Component D]" to [ON/OFF] ([0/100]%)
• This simulates [what?]
• What changes now?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• What combination creates the [MOST/WORST] [outcome]?
• What would need to change to [alternative outcome]?
• Does your model match what happens in the real world?
```

### Video Script

```
"[Opening — excitement about testing, 1-2 sentences]

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

[Describe baseline behavior — what should students see when things are "normal"?]

Now let's [change something]. Look at the right panel where your
components are listed. See the little lock icon next to [Component]?
Click it. Set [Component] to [value] percent.

This is [what real-world scenario this simulates].

Resume the simulation. Watch [Component B] start [rising/falling].
[Explain what's happening and why]

[Describe the cascade effect — dominoes falling]

[Add second scenario if applicable]

Look at [both graphs / the pattern]. [Key insight about the system]

You just simulated [real-world phenomenon]!

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

[Acknowledge what they built, but hint at complexity. 2-3 sentences]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • [Role-play scenario]
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you [change something]?
   • What happens if [another scenario]?
   • Can you find a combination where [alternative outcome]?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real [phenomena] involve more. Think about:

   • [Missing factor 1] — how might this connect?
   • [Missing factor 2] — where does this fit?
   • [Missing factor 3] — how would you model something that [does X]?
   • [Missing factor 4] — [question]
   • [Missing factor 5] — [question]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • [Topic they should look up]
   • [Related concept from curriculum]
   • [Connection to other units]

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • [Research question 1]
   • [Research question 2]
   • [Research question 3]
   • [Research question 4]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"[Acknowledge their model works. 1-2 sentences]

[Hint at complexity — real world is more complicated. 1-2 sentences]

First — tell the story. [Role-play prompt]. If you can explain it,
you understand it.

Second — break the system. [Specific things to try]. Play with the
locks and see what you discover.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has [X] components. Real [phenomenon] involves way more.
Think about...

[List 2-3 missing factors with guiding questions]

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's always
getting better.

[Closing question]

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

┌─────────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │          │                     │
