### Title
**The Invisible Plant Factory — How Plants Build Themselves from Thin Air and Sunlight**

### Overview
Photosynthesis is the most important chemical reaction on Earth. It converts solar energy into food energy, produces the oxygen we breathe, and is the foundation of almost every food chain on the planet. Students investigate the driving question: If plants make their own food from sunlight and air, where does the MASS of a giant tree actually come from? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE INVISIBLE PLANT FACTORY

How Plants Build Themselves from Thin Air and Sunlight.
If plants make their own food from sunlight and air, where does the MASS of a giant tree actually come from?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Sunlight Intensity" — the amount of light energy reaching the plant's leaves from the sun
  ○ Click "Water Availability" — the amount of water accessible to the plant through its root system
  ○ Click "CO₂ Concentration" — the amount of carbon dioxide in the air around the plant's leaves
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Chlorophyll Amount" — the quantity of light-capturing pigment in the plant's leaves

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"If plants make their own food from sunlight and air, where does the MASS of a giant tree actually come from?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Sunlight Intensity' — that's external. The amount of light energy reaching the plant's leaves from the Sun.
Click on 'Water Availability' — that's external. The amount of water accessible to the plant through its root system.
Click on 'CO₂ Concentration' — that's external. The amount of carbon dioxide in the air around the plant's leaves.
Click on 'Chlorophyll Amount' — that's internal. The quantity of light-capturing pigment in the plant's leaves.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Sunlight Intensity, Water Availability, and CO₂ Concentration are all external because they come from the environment and the plant cannot create them internally. Chlorophyll Amount is internal because it is a property of the plant itself that the plant produces in its leaf cells.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Sunlight Intensity" and drag an arrow to "Glucose Production"
• Click on "Water Availability" and drag an arrow to "Glucose Production"
• Click on "CO₂ Concentration" and drag an arrow to "Glucose Production"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Sunlight Intensity → Glucose Production = POSITIVE (+)
    More sunlight provides more energy to drive the photosynthesis reaction. Up to a saturation point, increased light directly increases glucose production.

  ○ Water Availability → Glucose Production = POSITIVE (+)
    Water is a direct reactant in photosynthesis (6H₂O needed per glucose molecule). Without water, the reaction cannot proceed regardless of other inputs.

  ○ CO₂ Concentration → Glucose Production = POSITIVE (+)
    CO₂ provides the carbon atoms that become glucose. More CO₂ allows the plant to build more sugar molecules, up to the point where another factor becomes limiting.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When sunlight intensity increases, what happens to the rate of photosynthesis? What happens when CO₂ runs low — can the plant still make food?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Sunlight Intensity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Glucose Production.'

Here's the key question: When sunlight intensity goes UP, does
glucose production go UP or DOWN?

More sunlight provides more energy to drive the photosynthesis reaction. Up to a saturation point, increased light directly increases glucose production.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Water Availability' and drag an arrow
over to 'Glucose Production.'

Here's the key question: When water availability goes UP, does
glucose production go UP or DOWN?

Water is a direct reactant in photosynthesis (6H₂O needed per glucose molecule). Without water, the reaction cannot proceed regardless of other inputs.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'CO₂ Concentration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Glucose Production.'

Here's the key question: When co₂ concentration goes UP, does
glucose production go UP or DOWN?

CO₂ provides the carbon atoms that become glucose. More CO₂ allows the plant to build more sugar molecules, up to the point where another factor becomes limiting.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When sunlight intensity increases, what happens to the rate of photosynthesis? What happens when CO₂ runs low — can the plant still make food?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Sunlight Intensity is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — PERFECT DAY
• High sunlight, adequate water and CO₂
• PREDICT FIRST: How much glucose do you predict a plant can make in ideal conditions?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — CLOUDY WEEK
• Lock Sunlight to 20%
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to glucose production when sunlight is limited?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — DROUGHT STRESS
• Water at 10%, other inputs normal
• PREDICT FIRST: Why can't the plant keep making food even though it has sunlight and CO₂?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Plants need ALL THREE inputs (sunlight, water, CO₂) — removing any one stops photosynthesis completely
• Most of a tree's mass comes from CARBON DIOXIDE in the air, not from the soil
• Photosynthesis is the reverse of cellular respiration — they're balanced opposite reactions
• More chlorophyll allows a plant to capture more light energy, increasing photosynthesis rate up to a saturation point

THE ANSWER: A giant tree's mass comes mostly from carbon dioxide in the AIR! During photosynthesis, plants pull CO₂ from the atmosphere and use light energy to rearrange the carbon atoms into glucose molecules. Those carbon atoms become the wood, bark, and leaves. A tree is literally built from air and sunlight — the soil mainly provides water and minerals!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Perfect Day. High sunlight, adequate water and CO₂.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Cloudy Week.
Lock Sunlight to 20%.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to glucose production when sunlight is limited?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Drought Stress. Water at 10%, other inputs normal.
Why can't the plant keep making food even though it has sunlight and CO₂?

Here's what our model reveals: A giant tree's mass comes mostly from carbon dioxide in the AIR! During photosynthesis, plants pull CO₂ from the atmosphere and use light energy to rearrange the carbon atoms into glucose molecules. Those carbon atoms become the wood, bark, and leaves. A tree is literally built from air and sunlight — the soil mainly provides water and minerals!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Sunlight Intensity?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Water Availability?
   • What happens if you turn OFF CO₂ Concentration?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Temperature — Enzymes that drive photosynthesis work best at specific temperatures — too hot or cold and they stop functioning
   • Soil Nutrients — Minerals like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from soil are needed for building proteins and DNA, not for photosynthesis directly
   • Leaf Surface Area — More leaf surface area captures more sunlight, but also loses more water through stomata

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Photosynthesis Equation — how does this connect to your model?
   • Where Does the Mass Come From? — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is it surprising that most of a tree's mass comes from air instead of soil?
   • How are photosynthesis and cellular respiration opposite processes?
   • What would happen to Earth's oxygen supply if all plants died?
   • Why do plants grow toward light? What advantage does this give them?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Temperature. Enzymes that drive photosynthesis work best at specific temperatures — too hot or cold and they stop functioning
How would you model that?

Soil Nutrients. Minerals like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium from soil are needed for building proteins and DNA, not for photosynthesis directly
How would you model that?

Leaf Surface Area. More leaf surface area captures more sunlight, but also loses more water through stomata
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

LESSON PURPOSE:
Photosynthesis is the most important chemical reaction on Earth. It converts solar energy into food energy, produces the oxygen we breathe, and is the foundation of almost every food chain on the planet.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS1-6: Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how sunlight, water, CO₂, and chlorophyll interact to drive photosynthesis and produce glucose.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.C Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms
  Plants use the energy from light to make sugars from carbon dioxide and water through photosynthesis, which releases oxygen. This is the entry point for energy and carbon into living systems.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation
  Students trace the flow of energy (sunlight → chemical energy in glucose) and matter (CO₂ + H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂) through the photosynthesis process.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Photosynthesis, Chlorophyll, Glucose, Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)
□ Prepare If plants make their own food from sunlight and air, where does the MASS of a giant tree actually come from discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify sunlight intensity, water availability, CO₂ concentration, and chlorophyll amount as the key inputs to photosynthesis.
• Establish: Students determine that all three external inputs positively affect photosynthesis rate (more input = more glucose), and that chlorophyll amount determines how much light the plant can capture.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how limiting factors control glucose production and how removing any single input stops the entire process.
• Evaluate: Students run perfect day, cloudy, and drought scenarios to identify which factor limits photosynthesis under different conditions.
• Revise: Students add temperature or leaf surface area to explore how additional factors affect photosynthesis in real plants.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Photosynthesis Equation:
  6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. In words: six molecules of carbon dioxide plus six molecules of water, powered by light energy, produce one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen. This seemingly simple reaction involves hundreds of molecular steps and is the basis of almost all life on Earth.

• Where Does the Mass Come From?:
  This is the most counterintuitive fact in plant biology: most of a tree's mass comes from CO₂ in the air, NOT from the soil. The famous Van Helmont experiment (1648) showed that a willow tree gained 75 kg while its soil lost only a few ounces. The carbon in CO₂ is rearranged into organic molecules that build wood, bark, leaves, and roots.

• Limiting Factors:
  Photosynthesis rate is limited by whichever input is in shortest supply — the 'law of the minimum.' On a sunny day with plenty of water, CO₂ is usually the limiting factor. On a cloudy day, light is limiting. During drought, water is limiting. This concept is critical for agriculture — farmers must provide ALL needed inputs for maximum crop yield.

• Global Importance:
  Plants and algae perform photosynthesis, producing about 300 billion tons of oxygen per year. Photosynthesis is also Earth's main carbon sink — removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. Deforestation reduces this capacity, contributing to climate change. Understanding photosynthesis is essential for addressing food security and climate challenges.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Plants get their food from soil"
  Reality: Plants get WATER and MINERALS from soil, but their actual food (glucose) is made through photosynthesis using CO₂ from air and light energy. Soil provides micronutrients but is NOT the main source of plant mass. Van Helmont proved this in 1648.
  Strategy: Classic demo: Grow a plant hydroponically (no soil) — it still thrives because it gets CO₂, water, and light.

• "Plants only do photosynthesis, not respiration"
  Reality: Plants do BOTH. During the day, photosynthesis produces more oxygen than respiration consumes, so the net effect is oxygen release. At night, plants only respire (consuming oxygen, releasing CO₂) just like animals. Plants are full-time respirers and part-time photosynthesizers.
  Strategy: Place a plant in a dark sealed container and test the air after 24 hours — CO₂ increases, oxygen decreases.

• "Photosynthesis is the reverse of breathing"
  Reality: While the equations are reverse, the processes are completely different. Photosynthesis uses light energy to BUILD glucose molecules (energy storage). Respiration BREAKS glucose to release energy (energy use). They happen in different organelles (chloroplasts vs. mitochondria) using different enzymes.
  Strategy: Compare: Building a house takes energy and materials. Demolishing a house releases materials. Both involve a house, but they're completely different processes.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: If plants make their own food from sunlight and air, where does the MASS of a giant tree actually come from?
Answer: A giant tree's mass comes mostly from carbon dioxide in the AIR! During photosynthesis, plants pull CO₂ from the atmosphere and use light energy to rearrange the carbon atoms into glucose molecules. Those carbon atoms become the wood, bark, and leaves. A tree is literally built from air and sunlight — the soil mainly provides water and minerals!

Simulation Answers:
• Cloudy Week Scenario: At 20% Sunlight Intensity, glucose production drops dramatically even though water and CO₂ are normal. Light is the energy source — without enough energy, the plant can't drive the chemical reaction fast enough. This demonstrates that sunlight is the limiting factor on cloudy days.
• Drought Stress Scenario: At 10% Water Availability, glucose production nearly stops despite adequate sunlight and CO₂. Water is both a reactant AND essential for keeping stomata open (pores that let CO₂ in). Without water, stomata close to prevent water loss, which also blocks CO₂ entry — a double hit to photosynthesis.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Where does tree mass come from?
  A: It's incredibly counterintuitive, but most of a tree's mass comes from carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere. During photosynthesis, plants take in CO₂ and use light energy to rearrange carbon atoms into glucose molecules. Those glucose molecules are then used to build cellulose (wood), lignin (bark), and other structural molecules. The tree is literally assembling itself from air molecules, one carbon atom at a time.
• Q: How are photosynthesis and respiration opposite?
  A: Photosynthesis: CO₂ + H₂O + light → glucose + O₂ (builds sugar, releases oxygen). Cellular respiration: glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy (breaks sugar, releases CO₂). They're mirror images! Plants do BOTH — photosynthesis during the day and respiration 24/7. Animals only do respiration. Together, these two reactions cycle carbon and oxygen through the biosphere.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Space Greenhouse
Mission: Design a greenhouse for a Mars colony that provides maximum food production by optimizing photosynthesis conditions in an environment with limited resources.
Scenario: NASA is planning a Mars colony and needs a self-sustaining greenhouse. Mars has 95% CO₂ atmosphere but only 43% of Earth's sunlight, limited water, and no soil. Your agricultural engineering team must design a greenhouse using your photosynthesis model evidence.
Introduction: Present the NASA Mars greenhouse scenario: Mars has 95% CO₂ but only 43% of Earth's sunlight, very limited water (ice at the poles), no soil, and extreme temperature swings. Your team must design a self-sustaining food production system.

Key Concepts:
• Limiting Factors in Agriculture: Crop yield is determined by whichever essential input is in shortest supply. Even if a greenhouse has perfect lighting, without enough water, plants can't photosynthesize. Farmers must optimize ALL inputs simultaneously.
• Hydroponics: Growing plants without soil by dissolving nutrients directly in water. This is ideal for space greenhouses because it uses less water, grows faster, and eliminates the need to transport heavy soil.
• Bioregenerative Life Support: A system where plants provide food and oxygen while recycling CO₂ and water from human waste. This creates a closed-loop ecosystem essential for long-term space missions.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Greenhouse design addresses all limiting factors on Mars, uses model evidence, includes specific crop recommendations, and explains water/air recycling
• Proficient (3): Design addresses at least two limiting factors with model evidence and includes a specific growing strategy
• Developing (2): Design mentions plants on Mars but doesn't address specific photosynthesis challenges
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't connect greenhouse features to photosynthesis requirements

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simple diagram of the photosynthesis equation with molecule counts labeled: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
  • Use LEGO bricks to physically model how carbon atoms from CO₂ are rearranged into glucose molecules
  • Sentence frames: 'When sunlight intensity decreases, glucose production __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how ocean phytoplankton perform photosynthesis and produce more than half of Earth's oxygen
  • Investigate how greenhouses increase CO₂ levels to boost crop growth — and the math behind it
  • Design an experiment to test whether the color of light affects photosynthesis rate

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Balance the photosynthesis equation by counting atoms on each side: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
  • ELA: Write an explanatory article for a younger student about where trees get their mass, debunking the common myth
  • Social Studies: Research the Green Revolution — how understanding photosynthesis led to agricultural changes that feed billions

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose
• Describe the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of carbon through ecosystems
• Use evidence to explain where the mass of a growing plant comes from

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A student grows two identical plants — one in sunlight and one in complete darkness. After 4 weeks, the plant in sunlight is thriving but the one in darkness has wilted. Which best explains this result?
• Constructed Response: A scientist weighs a potted tree seedling and its soil. After 5 years, the tree has gained 50 kg but the soil has only lost 0.5 kg. Explain where the other 49.5 kg of mass came from, using the process of photosynthesis.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Space Greenhouse
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a greenhouse for a Mars colony that provides maximum food production by optimizing photosynthesis conditions in an environment with limited resources.

SCENARIO: NASA is planning a Mars colony and needs a self-sustaining greenhouse. Mars has 95% CO₂ atmosphere but only 43% of Earth's sunlight, limited water, and no soil. Your agricultural engineering team must design a greenhouse using your photosynthesis model evidence.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How will you provide enough light for photosynthesis on Mars where sunlight is weaker?
• With 95% CO₂ on Mars, is carbon dioxide still a limiting factor? What IS the limiting factor?
• How will you recycle water and nutrients in a closed system?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What artificial lighting system will supplement the weaker Martian sunlight?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you supply and recycle water in a closed greenhouse system?

  _________________________________________________________

• Which crops will you grow to maximize calories per square meter?

  _________________________________________________________

• How does your greenhouse design address temperature, pressure, and radiation on Mars?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Greenhouse design addresses all limiting factors on Mars, uses model evidence, includes specific crop recommendations, and explains water/air recycling
• Proficient (3): Design addresses at least two limiting factors with model evidence and includes a specific growing strategy
• Developing (2): Design mentions plants on Mars but doesn't address specific photosynthesis challenges
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't connect greenhouse features to photosynthesis requirements
