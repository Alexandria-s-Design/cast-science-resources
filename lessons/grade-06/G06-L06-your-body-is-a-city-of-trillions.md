### Title
**Your Body Is a City of Trillions — How Your Organ Systems Work Together to Keep You Alive**

### Overview
The human body is an extraordinary system of interacting subsystems — approximately 11 organ systems working in concert to maintain life. Understanding these interactions is fundamental to health science and medicine. Students investigate the driving question: How does your body run a city more complex than any humans have ever built — 24/7, without you even thinking about it? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

YOUR BODY IS A CITY OF TRILLIONS

How Your Organ Systems Work Together to Keep You Alive.
How does your body run a city more complex than any humans have ever built — 24/7, without you even thinking about it?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Nutrient Intake" — the amount of glucose and other fuel molecules available from digested food
  ○ Click "Physical Activity" — the intensity of muscular work being performed
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Heart Rate" — how many times the heart beats per minute
  ○ Click "Blood Oxygen Level" — the percentage of hemoglobin in red blood cells carrying oxygen to tissues

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"How does your body run a city more complex than any humans have ever built — 24/7, without you even thinking about it?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Heart Rate' — that's internal. How many times the heart beats per minute.
Click on 'Blood Oxygen Level' — that's internal. The percentage of hemoglobin in red blood cells carrying oxygen to tissues.
Click on 'Nutrient Intake' — that's external. The amount of glucose and other fuel molecules available from digested food.
Click on 'Physical Activity' — that's external. The intensity of muscular work being performed.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Nutrient Intake and Physical Activity are external because they are controlled by the person's choices — what they eat and how hard they exercise. Heart Rate and Blood Oxygen Level are internal because they are automatic responses that the body adjusts in reaction to those external inputs.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Physical Activity" and drag an arrow to "Heart Rate"
• Click on "Physical Activity" and drag an arrow to "Blood Oxygen"
• Click on "Nutrient Intake" and drag an arrow to "Physical Performance"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Physical Activity → Heart Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Increased physical activity demands more oxygen and nutrients at muscle cells. The heart responds by beating faster to increase blood flow and delivery.

  ○ Physical Activity → Blood Oxygen = NEGATIVE (−)
    Intense activity consumes oxygen faster than the lungs can replace it, causing blood oxygen levels to temporarily drop during vigorous exercise.

  ○ Nutrient Intake → Physical Performance = POSITIVE (+)
    More available nutrients (especially glucose) provide more fuel for cellular respiration in muscle cells, supporting sustained physical activity.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When physical activity increases, what has to happen to heart rate and blood oxygen? Can your body keep exercising if nutrient intake is zero?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Physical Activity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Heart Rate.'

Here's the key question: When physical activity goes UP, does
heart rate go UP or DOWN?

Increased physical activity demands more oxygen and nutrients at muscle cells. The heart responds by beating faster to increase blood flow and delivery.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Physical Activity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Blood Oxygen.'

Here's the key question: When physical activity goes UP, does
blood oxygen go UP or DOWN?

Intense activity consumes oxygen faster than the lungs can replace it, causing blood oxygen levels to temporarily drop during vigorous exercise.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Nutrient Intake' and drag an arrow
over to 'Physical Performance.'

Here's the key question: When nutrient intake goes UP, does
physical performance go UP or DOWN?

More available nutrients (especially glucose) provide more fuel for cellular respiration in muscle cells, supporting sustained physical activity.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When physical activity increases, what has to happen to heart rate and blood oxygen? Can your body keep exercising if nutrient intake is zero?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Nutrient Intake is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — RESTING STATE
• Low physical activity, normal nutrients and oxygen
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict heart rate will be during rest? Why?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — SPRINT MODE
• Maximum physical activity
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to blood oxygen when you sprint? Why does heart rate increase?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — SKIPPING LUNCH
• Low nutrients, moderate activity
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to your body's performance when fuel runs low?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Heart rate increases during exercise to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to working muscles
• Blood oxygen drops during intense activity because muscles consume oxygen faster than lungs can replace it
• Without adequate nutrients, the body can't produce enough energy for sustained physical activity
• All organ systems are interconnected — when one system is stressed, others must compensate

THE ANSWER: Your body works like a city because every organ system has a specialized job, and they ALL depend on each other. Your digestive system provides fuel, your respiratory system provides oxygen, your circulatory system delivers both to every cell, and your muscular system creates movement. Remove any one system and the whole city shuts down — just like a real city without power, water, or roads!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Resting State. Low physical activity, normal nutrients and oxygen.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Sprint Mode.
Maximum physical activity.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to blood oxygen when you sprint? Why does heart rate increase?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Skipping Lunch. Low nutrients, moderate activity.
What happens to your body's performance when fuel runs low?

Here's what our model reveals: Your body works like a city because every organ system has a specialized job, and they ALL depend on each other. Your digestive system provides fuel, your respiratory system provides oxygen, your circulatory system delivers both to every cell, and your muscular system creates movement. Remove any one system and the whole city shuts down — just like a real city without power, water, or roads!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Nutrient Intake?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Physical Activity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Body Temperature — Internal temperature rises during exercise; the body must cool itself through sweating and blood flow to skin
   • Lactic Acid Buildup — During intense activity, muscles produce lactic acid faster than the body can clear it, causing fatigue and burning
   • Hydration Level — Water is essential for blood volume, sweating, and chemical reactions — dehydration degrades all body systems

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Levels of Organization — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Big Four Systems — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does your heart beat faster when you exercise? What problem is it solving?
   • What would happen to your muscles if your circulatory system stopped working?
   • How is your body like a city? Give at least three specific comparisons.
   • Why do athletes need to eat differently than people who sit at desks all day?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Body Temperature. Internal temperature rises during exercise; the body must cool itself through sweating and blood flow to skin
How would you model that?

Lactic Acid Buildup. During intense activity, muscles produce lactic acid faster than the body can clear it, causing fatigue and burning
How would you model that?

Hydration Level. Water is essential for blood volume, sweating, and chemical reactions — dehydration degrades all body systems
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: Your Body Is a City of Trillions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The human body is an extraordinary system of interacting subsystems — approximately 11 organ systems working in concert to maintain life. Understanding these interactions is fundamental to health science and medicine.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS1-3: Use argument supported by evidence for how the body is a system of interacting subsystems composed of groups of cells.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how heart rate, blood oxygen, nutrient intake, and physical activity interact as interacting body subsystems.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function
  In multicellular organisms, the body is a system of multiple interacting subsystems. These subsystems are groups of cells that work together to form tissues and organs.
• Crosscutting Concept: Systems and System Models
  Students use the concept of interacting systems to understand how changes in one body system (e.g., increased physical activity) cascade through other systems (increased heart rate, breathing rate, energy demand).

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Organ System, Homeostasis, Circulatory System, Cellular Respiration
□ Prepare How does your body run a city more complex than any humans have ever built — 24/7, without you even thinking about it discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify heart rate, blood oxygen level, nutrient intake, and physical activity as the key interacting components of the body system.
• Establish: Students determine that physical activity positively drives heart rate (compensation response) while negatively affecting blood oxygen (increased consumption), and that nutrient intake positively supports all body functions.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how the body's subsystems interact to maintain function during different activity levels.
• Evaluate: Students run resting, sprinting, and low-fuel scenarios to observe how the body compensates — and what happens when it can't.
• Revise: Students add body temperature, lactic acid, or hydration to explore more complex physiological responses.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Levels of Organization:
  The body is organized hierarchically: atoms → molecules → cells → tissues → organs → organ systems → organism. Each level has emergent properties that arise from the interactions of its components. A heart cell can beat on its own, but only the whole heart can pump blood effectively.

• The Big Four Systems:
  The four systems most relevant to exercise physiology are: Circulatory (heart, blood, vessels — transports everything), Respiratory (lungs, airways — gas exchange), Digestive (stomach, intestines — nutrient extraction), and Muscular (muscles — movement and heat production). During exercise, all four must increase their output simultaneously.

• Exercise Response:
  During exercise, muscles demand up to 20x more oxygen and glucose than at rest. The heart rate increases from ~70 to 180+ bpm. Breathing rate jumps from 12 to 40+ breaths/minute. Blood flow is redirected from digestive organs to muscles. These coordinated responses demonstrate how body systems communicate and cooperate.

• Homeostasis:
  Homeostasis is the body's ability to maintain stable internal conditions (temperature, blood sugar, pH, oxygen levels) despite changing external conditions. When you exercise in the heat, your body simultaneously increases heart rate (to feed muscles), produces sweat (to cool down), and adjusts breathing (to maintain oxygen). This multi-system coordination is homeostasis in action.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "The heart creates blood"
  Reality: The heart is a PUMP, not a factory. It pumps blood through blood vessels but doesn't create blood. New blood cells are made in bone marrow. The heart's job is transportation — moving blood where it needs to go, about 2,000 gallons per day.
  Strategy: Ask: Does a water pump create water? No — it moves water. The heart moves blood the same way.

• "You breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide"
  Reality: Air is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 0.04% CO₂. When you exhale, the air is still 78% nitrogen and about 16% oxygen — you only absorb a fraction of the oxygen. You exhale more CO₂ (4%) than you inhale, but the change is smaller than most people think.
  Strategy: Have students look at the actual composition of inhaled vs. exhaled air — the numbers are surprising.

• "Organs work independently"
  Reality: No organ system works alone. The heart needs signals from the nervous system, oxygen from the respiratory system, and nutrients from the digestive system. Every organ depends on every other organ through the circulatory system's delivery network. Disease in one system cascades to others.
  Strategy: Ask: What happens to muscles if the heart stops? What happens to the brain? Everything is connected.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does your body run a city more complex than any humans have ever built — 24/7, without you even thinking about it?
Answer: Your body works like a city because every organ system has a specialized job, and they ALL depend on each other. Your digestive system provides fuel, your respiratory system provides oxygen, your circulatory system delivers both to every cell, and your muscular system creates movement. Remove any one system and the whole city shuts down — just like a real city without power, water, or roads!

Simulation Answers:
• Sprint Mode Scenario: When Physical Activity is locked at maximum, Heart Rate spikes dramatically (70 → 170+ bpm) as the circulatory system compensates. Blood Oxygen drops because muscles consume oxygen faster than lungs can resupply. The model shows how the body's systems work together under stress — and that there's a limit to compensation.
• Skipping Lunch Scenario: At 10% Nutrient Intake during moderate activity, performance degrades within minutes. Without glucose fuel, muscles can't sustain contraction. Heart rate may initially compensate but the body quickly runs out of stored energy. This models why athletes 'hit the wall' — their fuel supply is depleted.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does heart rate increase during exercise?
  A: Muscles need oxygen and glucose to produce ATP (energy) through cellular respiration. When you exercise, muscles need up to 20x more fuel and oxygen than at rest. The heart beats faster to push more blood through the system, delivering more oxygen and nutrients per minute. It's like a city increasing bus service during rush hour — more demand requires more deliveries.
• Q: How is the body like a city?
  A: The circulatory system is like roads and delivery trucks (transporting supplies everywhere). The respiratory system is like air filtration (bringing in clean air, removing CO₂). The digestive system is like food processing plants (converting raw food into usable fuel). The muscular system is like the workforce (doing the physical jobs). The nervous system is like the communications network (coordinating everything). Remove any one system and the city collapses.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design an Athletic Performance Plan
Mission: Design an evidence-based training and nutrition plan for a student athlete that optimizes how their body systems work together during competition.
Scenario: A middle school track team needs help. Their coach wants your biomedical team to design a plan that helps runners perform their best in the 400-meter race. Use your body systems model to explain your recommendations.
Introduction: Present the athletic performance scenario: A middle school track team's coach needs science-based recommendations for nutrition, warm-up, and training strategies for the 400-meter race.

Key Concepts:
• VO₂ Max: The maximum rate at which the body can consume oxygen during exercise. Higher VO₂ max = better endurance performance. Training increases VO₂ max by strengthening the heart and increasing blood vessel density in muscles.
• Glycogen Loading: The strategy of eating carbohydrate-rich meals before competition to maximize glycogen (stored glucose) in muscles and liver. This provides more fuel for intense activity.
• Active Recovery: Light movement after intense exercise helps clear lactic acid faster than complete rest. Walking after a sprint helps the circulatory system flush waste from muscles.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses nutrition, warm-up, and training with model evidence, explains multiple system interactions, includes measurable performance goals
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses at least two factors with model evidence and explains system interactions
• Developing (2): Plan mentions exercise and nutrition but doesn't connect recommendations to body systems model
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of body system interactions

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a body systems diagram showing connections between circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and muscular systems
  • Use the 'City Analogy' chart: organ system → city equivalent (heart=water pump, lungs=air system, etc.)
  • Sentence frames: 'When physical activity increases, heart rate __ because muscles need __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how altitude training affects the circulatory system and blood oxygen capacity
  • Investigate what happens to body systems during sleep — does the 'city' ever fully shut down?
  • Compare the body systems of an elite athlete vs. an average person — what adaptations occur with training?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph heart rate data over time during rest, exercise, and recovery — calculate the rate of increase and decrease
  • ELA: Write a persuasive essay arguing that the digestive system is the MOST important body system, using evidence
  • PE/Health: Design a fitness assessment that tests circulatory, respiratory, and muscular system function

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Argue that the body is a system of interacting subsystems using evidence
• Explain how organ systems work together to maintain homeostasis
• Describe the hierarchical organization from cells to tissues to organs to organ systems

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: During intense exercise, a student's heart rate increases from 70 bpm to 160 bpm. Which best explains WHY the circulatory system responds this way?
• Constructed Response: A student eats a banana before running a race. Trace the journey of the banana's energy from digestion to muscle contraction, identifying at least three organ systems involved and how they interact.

REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Why does your heart beat faster when you exercise? What problem is it solving?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. What would happen to your muscles if your circulatory system stopped working?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. How is your body like a city? Give at least three specific comparisons.

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. Why do athletes need to eat differently than people who sit at desks all day?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. How does homeostasis keep your body working even when conditions change?

STEM CHALLENGE: Design an Athletic Performance Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design an evidence-based training and nutrition plan for a student athlete that optimizes how their body systems work together during competition.

SCENARIO: A middle school track team needs help. Their coach wants your biomedical team to design a plan that helps runners perform their best in the 400-meter race. Use your body systems model to explain your recommendations.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Based on your model, what happens to body systems during a 60-second sprint?
• What nutrients should the athlete eat before a race, and when should they eat them?
• How should training prepare the body's systems to handle the stress of competition?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What foods will provide the right type and amount of energy for a sprint?

  _________________________________________________________

• How should the athlete warm up to prepare their circulatory and respiratory systems?

  _________________________________________________________

• What is the ideal heart rate zone for peak performance vs. risk of exhaustion?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure whether your plan actually improves performance?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses nutrition, warm-up, and training with model evidence, explains multiple system interactions, includes measurable performance goals
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses at least two factors with model evidence and explains system interactions
• Developing (2): Plan mentions exercise and nutrition but doesn't connect recommendations to body systems model
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of body system interactions
