### Title
**Your Sneakers Are Made of Dinosaurs — How Scientists Engineer Materials That Don't Exist in Nature**

### Overview
Synthetic materials have transformed modern life. From the clothes on your back to the phone in your pocket, most everyday objects contain materials that don't exist in nature — materials engineered by chemists and materials scientists. Students investigate the driving question: If most of the stuff you wear, carry, and use every day doesn't exist in nature, where does it come from and what is it made of? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
6th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-PS1-3, MS-PS1-6**: Gather and make sense of information to describe that synthetic materials come from natural resources and impact society. Undertake a design project to construct, test, and modify a device that either releases or absorbs thermal energy by chemical processes.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain how synthetic materials are engineered from natural resources through chemical processes

|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Polymer Chain Length | Internal | The number of monomer units linked together in each chain — longer chains generally mean stronger materials |
| Heat Treatment | External | The temperature and duration of heating during manufacturing, which affects how polymer chains arrange themselves |
| Chemical Additives | Internal | Substances mixed in to modify properties — plasticizers for flexibility, colorants, UV stabilizers |
| Raw Material Quality | External | The purity and type of starting materials, typically derived from petroleum or plant-based sources |

YOUR SNEAKERS ARE MADE OF DINOSAURS

How Scientists Engineer Materials That Don't Exist in Nature.
If most of the stuff you wear, carry, and use every day doesn't exist in nature, where does it come from and what is it made of?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Heat Treatment" — the temperature and duration of heating during manufacturing
  ○ Click "Raw Material Quality" — the purity and type of starting materials
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Polymer Chain Length" — the number of monomer units linked together in each chain — longer chains generally mean stronger materials
  ○ Click "Chemical Additives" — substances mixed in to modify properties — plasticizers for flexibility

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"If most of the stuff you wear, carry, and use every day doesn't exist in nature, where does it come from and what is it made of?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Polymer Chain Length' — that's internal. The number of monomer units linked together in each chain — longer chains generally mean stronger materials.
Click on 'Heat Treatment' — that's external. The temperature and duration of heating during manufacturing.
Click on 'Chemical Additives' — that's internal. Substances mixed in to modify properties — plasticizers for flexibility.
Click on 'Raw Material Quality' — that's external. The purity and type of starting materials.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Heat Treatment and Raw Material Quality are external because they are manufacturing inputs that come from outside the material itself — factory conditions and supply chain choices. Polymer Chain Length and Chemical Additives are internal because they are properties of the material itself that determine its final characteristics.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Polymer Chain Length" and drag an arrow to "Material Strength"
• Click on "Heat Treatment" and drag an arrow to "Crystallinity"
• Click on "Chemical Additives (Plasticizers)" and drag an arrow to "Flexibility"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Polymer Chain Length → Material Strength = POSITIVE (+)
    Longer polymer chains tangle and interlock more effectively, creating stronger intermolecular forces. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene has chains so long it can stop bullets.

  ○ Heat Treatment → Crystallinity = POSITIVE (+)
    Controlled heating allows polymer chains to organize into ordered crystalline regions. More crystallinity means harder, stiffer, more heat-resistant material.

  ○ Chemical Additives (Plasticizers) → Flexibility = POSITIVE (+)
    Plasticizer molecules insert between polymer chains, pushing them apart and allowing them to slide more easily. This converts rigid PVC pipe into flexible PVC cling wrap — same polymer, different properties.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When polymer chain length increases, how does it affect material strength? What happens when you add plasticizer additives — does the material get stiffer or more flexible?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Polymer Chain Length' and drag an arrow
over to 'Material Strength.'

Here's the key question: When polymer chain length goes UP, does
material strength go UP or DOWN?

Longer polymer chains tangle and interlock more effectively, creating stronger intermolecular forces. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene has chains so long it can stop bullets.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Heat Treatment' and drag an arrow
over to 'Crystallinity.'

Here's the key question: When heat treatment goes UP, does
crystallinity go UP or DOWN?

Controlled heating allows polymer chains to organize into ordered crystalline regions. More crystallinity means harder, stiffer, more heat-resistant material.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Chemical Additives (Plasticizers)' and drag an arrow
over to 'Flexibility.'

Here's the key question: When chemical additives (plasticizers) goes UP, does
flexibility go UP or DOWN?

Plasticizer molecules insert between polymer chains, pushing them apart and allowing them to slide more easily. This converts rigid PVC pipe into flexible PVC cling wrap — same polymer, different properties.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When polymer chain length increases, how does it affect material strength? What happens when you add plasticizer additives — does the material get stiffer or more flexible?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Heat Treatment is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — WEAK PLASTIC
• Short chains, minimal treatment
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict this material will be like — strong or brittle?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — SUPER STRONG
• Maximum chain length, optimal heat treatment
• PREDICT FIRST: How will this material compare to the weak plastic?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — FLEXIBLE FILM
• Maximum plasticizer additives
• PREDICT FIRST: How do additives change a rigid plastic into a flexible film?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Longer polymer chains create stronger materials because chains tangle and hold together better
• Heat treatment allows polymer chains to organize into crystalline structures, dramatically increasing strength
• Additives can completely change a material's properties — the same base polymer can become rigid OR flexible
• Almost all synthetic materials trace back to petroleum (ancient organisms), making your sneakers literally made from transformed ancient life

THE ANSWER: Your sneakers, phone case, and backpack are made from synthetic materials engineered from petroleum — which is the transformed remains of ancient organisms (including dinosaurs' contemporaries). Scientists take these natural resources and rearrange their molecules through polymerization, heat treatment, and additives to create materials with properties that don't exist in nature: lightweight, waterproof, flexible, and durable all at once!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Weak Plastic. Short chains, minimal treatment.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Super Strong.
Maximum chain length, optimal heat treatment.

Before you run it — make a prediction. How will this material compare to the weak plastic?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Flexible Film. Maximum plasticizer additives.
How do additives change a rigid plastic into a flexible film?

Here's what our model reveals: Your sneakers, phone case, and backpack are made from synthetic materials engineered from petroleum — which is the transformed remains of ancient organisms (including dinosaurs' contemporaries). Scientists take these natural resources and rearrange their molecules through polymerization, heat treatment, and additives to create materials with properties that don't exist in nature: lightweight, waterproof, flexible, and durable all at once!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Heat Treatment?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Raw Material Quality?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Cross-Linking Density — Chemical bonds between polymer chains that create a network — more cross-links mean stiffer, more heat-resistant material
   • Recycled Content — The percentage of material made from recycled sources rather than virgin petroleum — affects both properties and sustainability
   • Biodegradability — How quickly the material breaks down in the environment — a critical property for environmental sustainability

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • From Petroleum to Plastic — how does this connect to your model?
   • How Properties Are Controlled — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why can the same base polymer become a rigid water bottle OR a flexible plastic bag?
   • What are the environmental trade-offs of synthetic materials — benefits vs. costs?
   • How is making a polymer similar to building with LEGO bricks?
   • Why is it important to develop plant-based alternatives to petroleum plastics?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Cross-Linking Density. Chemical bonds between polymer chains that create a network — more cross-links mean stiffer, more heat-resistant material
How would you model that?

Recycled Content. The percentage of material made from recycled sources rather than virgin petroleum — affects both properties and sustainability
How would you model that?

Biodegradability. How quickly the material breaks down in the environment — a critical property for environmental sustainability
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Your Sneakers Are Made of Dinosaurs
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Synthetic materials have transformed modern life. From the clothes on your back to the phone in your pocket, most everyday objects contain materials that don't exist in nature — materials engineered by chemists and materials scientists.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS1-3, MS-PS1-6: Gather and make sense of information to describe that synthetic materials come from natural resources and impact society. Undertake a design project to construct, test, and modify a device that either releases or absorbs thermal energy by chemical processes.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how polymer chain length, heat treatment, additives, and raw materials determine synthetic material properties.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS1.A Structure and Properties of Matter / PS1.B Chemical Reactions
  Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical properties that can be used to identify it. Substances react chemically in characteristic ways, and chemical processes can be designed to produce desired materials.
• Crosscutting Concept: Structure and Function
  Students discover that the molecular STRUCTURE of synthetic materials (chain length, arrangement, additives) directly determines their FUNCTION (strength, flexibility, durability).

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Synthetic Material, Natural Resource, Polymerization, Material Properties
□ Prepare If most of the stuff you wear, carry, and use every day doesn't exist in nature, where does it come from and what is it made of discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify polymer chain length, heat treatment, chemical additives, and raw material quality as the key variables determining synthetic material properties.
• Establish: Students determine that longer chains and optimal heat treatment increase strength (positive), while plasticizer additives decrease rigidity (negative relationship with stiffness but positive with flexibility).
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how molecular-level decisions during manufacturing determine the final material's macroscopic properties.
• Evaluate: Students run weak plastic, super strong, and flexible film scenarios to see how the same base chemistry produces radically different materials.
• Revise: Students add cross-linking density or recycled content to explore additional factors in material design.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• From Petroleum to Plastic:
  Crude oil (petroleum) is a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules formed from ancient marine organisms over millions of years. Refineries separate these molecules by size (distillation). Chemical plants then link small hydrocarbon molecules (monomers) into long chains (polymers) through polymerization. Different monomers and processes create different plastics with vastly different properties.

• How Properties Are Controlled:
  Materials scientists control properties by adjusting: chain length (longer = stronger), branching (more branches = less dense), cross-linking (more = stiffer), crystallinity (more = harder), and additives (plasticizers for flexibility, fillers for strength, pigments for color). The same base polymer — polyethylene — becomes grocery bags (low density, branched) OR bulletproof plates (ultra-high molecular weight, aligned chains).

• Environmental Impact:
  Synthetic materials provide enormous benefits: medical devices, safety equipment, lightweight transportation, and food preservation. However, petroleum-based plastics don't biodegrade easily, creating pollution that persists for hundreds of years. Only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled. Scientists are now developing biodegradable polymers from plant-based sources as alternatives.

• The Future of Materials:
  Cutting-edge materials science is producing: self-healing polymers that repair their own damage, shape-memory materials that return to preset shapes, biodegradable plastics from corn and sugarcane, graphene (one atom thick but 200x stronger than steel), and programmable materials that change properties on demand. Understanding molecular structure is the key to all of these innovations.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Plastic comes from chemicals, not nature"
  Reality: ALL synthetic materials start as natural resources — primarily petroleum (ancient organisms) or sometimes plants. 'Chemical' processes rearrange natural molecules into new structures. Nothing in plastic was created from nothing — it's all rearranged atoms from Earth's resources.
  Strategy: Show the chain: prehistoric organisms → petroleum → refinery → monomers → polymer → product. It all starts in nature.

• "All plastics are the same"
  Reality: There are thousands of different plastics with vastly different properties. Polyethylene (PE) is in grocery bags. Polystyrene (PS) is in foam cups. Polycarbonate (PC) is in bulletproof glass. They're all polymers but with different monomers, chain lengths, and structures — like how different LEGO sets use the same basic bricks but create completely different things.
  Strategy: Show students 5 different plastic products and have them feel the differences — all 'plastic' but completely different materials.

• "Recycling solves the plastic problem"
  Reality: Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled. Many plastics degrade in quality when recycled (downcycling) and can only be recycled 1-2 times. True solutions require reducing plastic use, designing for recyclability from the start, and developing biodegradable alternatives.
  Strategy: Ask: If recycling solved everything, why is there plastic in the ocean? The answer reveals the gap between recycling's promise and reality.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: If most of the stuff you wear, carry, and use every day doesn't exist in nature, where does it come from and what is it made of?
Answer: Your sneakers, phone case, and backpack are made from synthetic materials engineered from petroleum — which is the transformed remains of ancient organisms (including dinosaurs' contemporaries). Scientists take these natural resources and rearrange their molecules through polymerization, heat treatment, and additives to create materials with properties that don't exist in nature: lightweight, waterproof, flexible, and durable all at once!

Simulation Answers:
• Weak vs. Super Strong: Short polymer chains with minimal heat treatment produce a brittle, weak material that breaks easily. Maximum chain length with optimal heat treatment produces a material that is dramatically stronger, harder, and more durable. The model shows that chain length and processing are the primary drivers of strength.
• Flexible Film Scenario: Adding maximum plasticizer additives to the same base polymer completely transforms it from rigid to flexible. The plasticizer molecules act as molecular lubricant, allowing chains to slide past each other. This demonstrates that a material's properties aren't fixed — they're engineered.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why can the same polymer be rigid or flexible?
  A: A polymer's properties depend not just on what molecules it contains but how they're arranged. Without plasticizers, PVC polymer chains are packed tightly and locked together by intermolecular forces — resulting in rigid pipe. Add plasticizer molecules and they wedge between chains, pushing them apart and allowing them to slide — resulting in flexible cling wrap. Same molecule, completely different behavior, controlled by additives.
• Q: What are the trade-offs of synthetic materials?
  A: Benefits: synthetic materials are lightweight, durable, waterproof, cheap to produce, and can be engineered for specific purposes. No natural material matches the versatility of plastics. Costs: petroleum extraction has environmental impacts, plastics persist in the environment for centuries, only 9% is recycled, and microplastics are now found in every ecosystem on Earth including human blood. The challenge is keeping the benefits while eliminating the environmental costs.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Sustainable Material of the Future
Mission: Design a new material for a specific product that is both high-performance AND environmentally sustainable, replacing a petroleum-based plastic.
Scenario: A sportswear company wants to eliminate petroleum-based plastics from their products by 2030. Your materials engineering team must design a replacement material for running shoe soles that matches the performance of current materials while using sustainable raw materials.
Introduction: Present the sportswear company challenge: They need a petroleum-free shoe sole material that matches current performance. Your team must design a sustainable alternative using molecular engineering principles.

Key Concepts:
• Bio-Based Polymers: Polymers made from renewable biological sources like corn starch (PLA), sugarcane (bio-PE), or castor oil (bio-nylon). These replace petroleum with plant-based carbon while maintaining similar material properties.
• Lifecycle Analysis: Evaluating a material's total environmental impact from raw material extraction through manufacturing, use, and disposal. A truly sustainable material must be better at EVERY stage, not just one.
• Circular Economy: Designing materials that can be recycled, composted, or safely returned to the environment after use. This eliminates the concept of 'waste' — every material becomes a resource for the next product.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design specifies sustainable raw materials, molecular properties (chain length, additives), performance testing plan, and lifecycle analysis
• Proficient (3): Design addresses sustainability and performance with model evidence and at least two property targets
• Developing (2): Design mentions sustainable materials but doesn't connect molecular structure to performance
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of how molecular structure determines material properties

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a chart comparing natural vs. synthetic materials with their properties listed side by side
  • Use physical LEGO chains of different lengths to demonstrate how chain length affects tangle/strength
  • Sentence frames: 'When polymer chain length increases, the material becomes __ because the molecules __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how Adidas is making shoes from recycled ocean plastic — what molecular processes are involved?
  • Investigate graphene — a one-atom-thick material 200x stronger than steel — and explain its properties from molecular structure
  • Design an experiment to compare the strength and flexibility of different plastic types using a standardized test

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the percentage of everyday objects that contain synthetic materials — survey 20 items and categorize
  • ELA: Write an argumentative essay: Should single-use plastics be banned? Use evidence from materials science
  • Social Studies: Research how the invention of synthetic materials (nylon, polyester, plastic) transformed the economy in the 20th century

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how synthetic materials are derived from natural resources through chemical processes
• Describe how molecular structure determines material properties
• Evaluate the societal impacts of synthetic materials — both benefits and environmental costs

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Two plastic samples are made from the same polymer. Sample A is rigid and Sample B is flexible. What molecular-level difference most likely explains this?
• Constructed Response: Explain why petroleum (crude oil) can be transformed into thousands of different synthetic materials with different properties. Use the concepts of polymerization, chain length, and additives in your answer.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Sustainable Material of the Future
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a new material for a specific product that is both high-performance AND environmentally sustainable, replacing a petroleum-based plastic.

SCENARIO: A sportswear company wants to eliminate petroleum-based plastics from their products by 2030. Your materials engineering team must design a replacement material for running shoe soles that matches the performance of current materials while using sustainable raw materials.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What properties must the replacement material have to work as a shoe sole?
• Which sustainable raw materials (plant-based, recycled) could replace petroleum?
• How will you test whether your material matches the performance of current shoe soles?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What natural or recycled raw materials will you start with?

  _________________________________________________________

• What polymer chain length and heat treatment will give you the needed durability?

  _________________________________________________________

• What additives will provide the right combination of cushioning and grip?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure performance: bounce, durability, water resistance, or something else?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design specifies sustainable raw materials, molecular properties (chain length, additives), performance testing plan, and lifecycle analysis
• Proficient (3): Design addresses sustainability and performance with model evidence and at least two property targets
• Developing (2): Design mentions sustainable materials but doesn't connect molecular structure to performance
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of how molecular structure determines material properties
