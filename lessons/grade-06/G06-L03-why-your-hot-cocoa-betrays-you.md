### Title
**Why Your Hot Cocoa Betrays You — The Science of Thermal Energy Transfer**

### Overview
Thermal energy transfer is one of the most fundamental and observable physics concepts. Every student has experienced a hot drink cooling down — this lesson connects that everyday experience to the science of energy flow. Students investigate the driving question: No matter what you do, your hot cocoa always gets cold — where does the heat actually go? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
6th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-PS3-3, MS-PS3-4**: Apply scientific principles to design, construct, and test a device that either minimizes or maximizes thermal energy transfer. Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass, and the change in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain how thermal energy transfers from hot objects to cold surroundings through conduction, convection, and radiation
- Model how temperature difference, insulation, surface area, and air movement affect heat loss
- Design a system that minimizes thermal energy transfer to keep a drink hot longer
- Connect thermal energy transfer to real-world engineering problems

### Component List (Starting Model: 3-4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Temperature Difference | External | The gap between the hot cocoa temperature and the room temperature |
| Insulation Level | Internal | How well the container prevents heat from escaping through its walls |
| Container Surface Area | Internal | The total outer area of the container exposed to the cooler environment |

WHY YOUR HOT COCOA BETRAYS YOU

The Science of Thermal Energy Transfer.
No matter what you do, your hot cocoa always gets cold — where does the heat actually go?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Temperature Difference" — the gap between the hot cocoa temperature and the room temperature
  ○ Click "Air Movement" — the speed of air flowing past the container
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Insulation Level" — how well the container prevents heat from escaping through its walls
  ○ Click "Container Surface Area" — the total outer area of the container exposed to the cooler environment

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"No matter what you do, your hot cocoa always gets cold — where does the heat actually go?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Temperature Difference' — that's external. The gap between the hot cocoa temperature and the room temperature.
Click on 'Insulation Level' — that's internal. How well the container prevents heat from escaping through its walls.
Click on 'Container Surface Area' — that's internal. The total outer area of the container exposed to the cooler environment.
Click on 'Air Movement' — that's external. The speed of air flowing past the container.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Temperature Difference and Air Movement are external because they come from the environment — the room temperature and wind are outside factors the drink can't control. Insulation Level and Container Surface Area are internal design features of the container that can be engineered to control heat loss.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Temperature Difference" and drag an arrow to "Heat Loss Rate"
• Click on "Insulation Level" and drag an arrow to "Heat Loss Rate"
• Click on "Air Movement" and drag an arrow to "Heat Loss Rate"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Temperature Difference → Heat Loss Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    The bigger the gap between hot cocoa and room temperature, the faster heat flows out. As the drink cools and the gap shrinks, heat loss slows down naturally.

  ○ Insulation Level → Heat Loss Rate = NEGATIVE (−)
    Better insulation slows thermal energy transfer by trapping air and blocking conduction. A well-insulated container dramatically reduces cooling rate.

  ○ Air Movement → Heat Loss Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Moving air carries away warm air molecules and replaces them with cool ones (convection). Wind or a fan dramatically increases the rate of heat loss.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When insulation level increases, what happens to the rate of heat loss? Is a tall thin mug or a short wide mug better for keeping cocoa hot — and why?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Temperature Difference' and drag an arrow
over to 'Heat Loss Rate.'

Here's the key question: When temperature difference goes UP, does
heat loss rate go UP or DOWN?

The bigger the gap between hot cocoa and room temperature, the faster heat flows out. As the drink cools and the gap shrinks, heat loss slows down naturally.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Insulation Level' and drag an arrow
over to 'Heat Loss Rate.'

Here's the key question: When insulation level goes UP, does
heat loss rate go UP or DOWN?

Better insulation slows thermal energy transfer by trapping air and blocking conduction. A well-insulated container dramatically reduces cooling rate.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Air Movement' and drag an arrow
over to 'Heat Loss Rate.'

Here's the key question: When air movement goes UP, does
heat loss rate go UP or DOWN?

Moving air carries away warm air molecules and replaces them with cool ones (convection). Wind or a fan dramatically increases the rate of heat loss.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When insulation level increases, what happens to the rate of heat loss? Is a tall thin mug or a short wide mug better for keeping cocoa hot — and why?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Temperature Difference is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — OPEN MUG
• No insulation, normal air movement
• PREDICT FIRST: How long do you predict it will take for your cocoa to reach room temperature?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — TRAVEL MUG
• Insulation at 80%, normal conditions
• PREDICT FIRST: How much longer will the cocoa stay hot compared to the open mug?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — WINDY DAY
• Maximum air movement, no insulation
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to heat loss rate on a windy day?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Heat ALWAYS flows from hot to cold — never the other way — until temperatures equalize
• Insulation doesn't add heat; it just slows down the transfer to the environment
• More surface area means faster heat loss because there's more area for energy to escape
• Moving air carries heat away much faster than still air (convection accelerates cooling)

THE ANSWER: Your hot cocoa loses heat to its cooler surroundings through three mechanisms: conduction (through the mug), convection (warm air rising off the surface), and radiation (infrared energy). Heat always flows from hot to cold until both reach the same temperature — that's the Second Law of Thermodynamics in your kitchen!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Open Mug. No insulation, normal air movement.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Travel Mug.
Insulation at 80%, normal conditions.

Before you run it — make a prediction. How much longer will the cocoa stay hot compared to the open mug?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Windy Day. Maximum air movement, no insulation.
What do you predict happens to heat loss rate on a windy day?

Here's what our model reveals: Your hot cocoa loses heat to its cooler surroundings through three mechanisms: conduction (through the mug), convection (warm air rising off the surface), and radiation (infrared energy). Heat always flows from hot to cold until both reach the same temperature — that's the Second Law of Thermodynamics in your kitchen!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Temperature Difference?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Air Movement?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Radiation Rate — Heat loss through infrared energy that radiates from the hot surface to the surroundings
   • Container Material — Different materials conduct heat at different rates — metal vs. ceramic vs. foam
   • Liquid Volume — More liquid stores more thermal energy, taking longer to cool down

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Three Methods of Heat Transfer — how does this connect to your model?
   • Temperature and Particle Motion — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does blowing on hot soup cool it down faster?
   • If insulation doesn't create heat, how does a winter coat keep you warm?
   • Why is a thermos designed with a vacuum layer? What does the vacuum prevent?
   • Would your hot cocoa cool faster in a metal cup or a foam cup? Explain why.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Radiation Rate. Heat loss through infrared energy that radiates from the hot surface to the surroundings
How would you model that?

Container Material. Different materials conduct heat at different rates — metal vs. ceramic vs. foam
How would you model that?

Liquid Volume. More liquid stores more thermal energy, taking longer to cool down
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Your Hot Cocoa Betrays You
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Thermal energy transfer is one of the most fundamental and observable physics concepts. Every student has experienced a hot drink cooling down — this lesson connects that everyday experience to the science of energy flow.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS3-3, MS-PS3-4: Apply scientific principles to design, construct, and test a device that either minimizes or maximizes thermal energy transfer. Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass, and the change in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how temperature difference, insulation, surface area, and air movement affect thermal energy transfer rates.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS3.A Definitions of Energy / PS3.B Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles. Energy transfers from hot to cold objects through conduction, convection, and radiation.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation
  Students trace the flow of thermal energy from the hot drink through the container to the surrounding environment, understanding that energy is conserved but transferred.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Thermal Energy, Conduction, Convection, Insulation
□ Prepare No matter what you do, your hot cocoa always gets cold — where does the heat actually go discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify temperature difference, insulation level, container surface area, and air movement as the key components affecting heat loss.
• Establish: Students determine that insulation negatively affects heat loss (slows it down) while air movement and surface area positively affect heat loss (speed it up).
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how these four factors interact to determine how quickly a hot drink cools.
• Evaluate: Students run open mug vs. travel mug vs. windy day scenarios to quantify the impact of each variable.
• Revise: Students add radiation rate or container material to make the model more comprehensive.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Three Methods of Heat Transfer:
  Conduction: energy transfer through direct molecular contact (metal spoon in hot soup). Convection: energy transfer through fluid movement (warm air rising from a heater). Radiation: energy transfer through electromagnetic waves (feeling warmth from the sun). All three happen simultaneously with your hot cocoa.

• Temperature and Particle Motion:
  Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of particles. In a hot drink, water molecules are moving fast. They transfer their kinetic energy to slower-moving air molecules through collisions. This is conduction at the molecular level. The drink cools because its particles slow down.

• Insulation Science:
  Good insulators work by trapping pockets of air. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so trapped air layers create barriers to conduction. Foam cups, down jackets, and double-pane windows all use this principle. A vacuum (no air at all) is the best insulator — that's how a thermos works.

• Real-World Applications:
  Thermal engineering is critical in building design (insulation, HVAC systems), spacecraft (extreme temperature management), electronics (heat sinks), and food safety (keeping hot foods hot and cold foods cold). Understanding heat transfer saves energy, money, and lives.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Cold flows into warm objects"
  Reality: Cold is not a substance that flows. Only thermal energy (heat) flows — always from hot to cold. When your cocoa cools, heat is leaving the drink, not cold entering it. 'Feeling cold' means your body is losing heat to the environment.
  Strategy: Ask: When you open a freezer, does cold come out or does heat go in? Feel the air — it's your body heat leaving!

• "Insulation creates heat"
  Reality: Insulation doesn't generate any energy. It simply slows down the rate of heat transfer. A jacket keeps you warm by trapping your body's heat, not by creating warmth. If you put a coat on a snowman, it would actually melt SLOWER.
  Strategy: Demo: Put a thermometer inside a jacket with no heat source — the temperature doesn't rise.

• "Metal objects are colder than wooden objects"
  Reality: At room temperature, metal and wood are the SAME temperature. Metal just FEELS colder because it conducts heat away from your hand much faster than wood does. Your brain interprets rapid heat loss as 'cold.'
  Strategy: Measure both with a thermometer — they're identical! But your hand says otherwise because of conduction speed.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: No matter what you do, your hot cocoa always gets cold — where does the heat actually go?
Answer: Your hot cocoa loses heat to its cooler surroundings through three mechanisms: conduction (through the mug), convection (warm air rising off the surface), and radiation (infrared energy). Heat always flows from hot to cold until both reach the same temperature — that's the Second Law of Thermodynamics in your kitchen!

Simulation Answers:
• Open Mug vs. Travel Mug: The open mug loses heat rapidly — temperature drops quickly in the first 15-20 minutes then slows as it approaches room temperature. The travel mug (80% insulation) loses heat much more slowly, maintaining a drinkable temperature 3-4 times longer. The model shows insulation's dramatic effect.
• Windy Day Scenario: With maximum air movement, the open mug cools even faster than in still air. Wind accelerates convection, the most significant heat loss mechanism for a hot liquid. The model shows that convection can double or triple the cooling rate compared to still air.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does blowing on soup cool it down?
  A: Blowing on soup accelerates convection. Your breath pushes away the layer of warm air sitting above the soup and replaces it with cooler air. This increases the temperature difference at the surface and speeds up heat transfer. You're essentially creating artificial wind that strips away the warm air boundary layer.
• Q: How does a coat keep you warm if it doesn't create heat?
  A: Your body generates heat through metabolism. A coat traps air between its fibers, creating insulation layers. These trapped air pockets slow the conduction of your body heat to the cold outside air. The coat doesn't warm you — it prevents your own heat from escaping. That's why a coat in a closet isn't warm but a coat on your body is.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design the Ultimate Hot Cocoa Keeper
Mission: Design and test a container that keeps hot cocoa above 50°C for as long as possible using your understanding of thermal energy transfer.
Scenario: A beverage company is holding a design competition. They need a new travel mug that keeps drinks hot for at least 2 hours without electricity. Your engineering team must use model evidence to design, build, and test a prototype.
Introduction: Present the design challenge: A beverage company needs a travel mug that keeps drinks above 50°C for 2 hours. Your team must design, prototype, and test a solution using evidence from your thermal model.

Key Concepts:
• R-Value (Insulation Rating): A measure of how well a material resists heat flow. Higher R-value = better insulation. Materials like foam and fiberglass have high R-values.
• Thermal Equilibrium: The state when two objects reach the same temperature and heat transfer stops. Your goal is to delay reaching equilibrium as long as possible.
• Vacuum Insulation: Removing air entirely (creating a vacuum) eliminates convection and conduction, leaving only radiation. This is how thermos bottles work.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design addresses all three heat transfer methods, uses model evidence, includes test data, and demonstrates understanding of thermal equilibrium
• Proficient (3): Design addresses at least two heat transfer methods with model evidence and testing plan
• Developing (2): Design mentions insulation but doesn't connect specific features to heat transfer types
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of thermal energy transfer

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a graphic organizer comparing conduction, convection, and radiation with everyday examples
  • Let students feel different materials (metal, wood, foam, fabric) at the same temperature to experience conduction differences
  • Sentence frames: 'When air movement increases, heat loss __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how thermos bottles use vacuum insulation and explain why a vacuum stops conduction and convection
  • Design an experiment to measure which material is the best insulator (foam, wool, bubble wrap, aluminum foil)
  • Investigate how thermal energy transfer applies to building design — why are some houses colder than others?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph cooling curves for different containers and calculate the rate of temperature change per minute
  • ELA: Write product marketing copy for your insulated container design, explaining the science to consumers
  • Social Studies: Research how different cultures developed insulation solutions for extreme climates (igloos, adobe, yurts)

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how thermal energy transfers between objects of different temperatures
• Apply understanding of heat transfer to design solutions that control energy flow
• Identify the relationship between particle motion and temperature

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A student places a metal spoon and a wooden spoon in the same cup of hot water. After 2 minutes, the metal spoon feels much hotter. Which best explains this observation?
• Constructed Response: Design and describe a container that would keep an ice cube frozen for as long as possible. Explain how your design minimizes thermal energy transfer using conduction, convection, and radiation.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design the Ultimate Hot Cocoa Keeper
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design and test a container that keeps hot cocoa above 50°C for as long as possible using your understanding of thermal energy transfer.

SCENARIO: A beverage company is holding a design competition. They need a new travel mug that keeps drinks hot for at least 2 hours without electricity. Your engineering team must use model evidence to design, build, and test a prototype.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which method of heat transfer causes the MOST heat loss from a typical mug?
• What materials and design features will minimize each type of thermal energy transfer?
• How will you test whether your design actually works better than a regular mug?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What insulating materials will you use and why?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you minimize the surface area exposed to air?

  _________________________________________________________

• Will your design include a lid? Why is the top surface important?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure and compare your design's performance to a control mug?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design addresses all three heat transfer methods, uses model evidence, includes test data, and demonstrates understanding of thermal equilibrium
• Proficient (3): Design addresses at least two heat transfer methods with model evidence and testing plan
• Developing (2): Design mentions insulation but doesn't connect specific features to heat transfer types
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of thermal energy transfer
