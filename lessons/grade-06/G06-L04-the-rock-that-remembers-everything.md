### Title
**The Rock That Remembers Everything — How Earth's Rocks Tell the Story of Millions of Years**

### Overview
The rock cycle is one of Earth's most fundamental processes, recycling materials over billions of years. Every rock on Earth has a story to tell about the conditions under which it formed. Students investigate the driving question: How can a rock on top of a mountain contain seashells from the bottom of an ancient ocean? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE ROCK THAT REMEMBERS EVERYTHING

How Earth's Rocks Tell the Story of Millions of Years.
How can a rock on top of a mountain contain seashells from the bottom of an ancient ocean?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Heat & Pressure" — the thermal energy and compression forces from earth's interior that transform rocks
  ○ Click "Weathering Rate" — how quickly wind
  ○ Click "Time" — the immense timescale over which geological processes operate — millions to billions of years
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Sediment Layers" — the accumulation of broken rock particles

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"How can a rock on top of a mountain contain seashells from the bottom of an ancient ocean?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Heat & Pressure' — that's external. The thermal energy and compression forces from Earth's interior that transform rocks.
Click on 'Weathering Rate' — that's external. How quickly wind.
Click on 'Sediment Layers' — that's internal. The accumulation of broken rock particles.
Click on 'Time' — that's external. The immense timescale over which geological processes operate — millions to billions of years.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Heat & Pressure, Weathering Rate, and Time are external because they are environmental forces acting ON the rock system — heat comes from Earth's interior, weathering comes from surface conditions, and time is an independent variable. Sediment Layers are internal because they accumulate as a RESULT of weathering and represent the system's response to external forces.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Heat & Pressure" and drag an arrow to "Rock Transformation"
• Click on "Weathering Rate" and drag an arrow to "Sediment Layers"
• Click on "Sediment Layers" and drag an arrow to "Fossil Preservation"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Heat & Pressure → Rock Transformation = POSITIVE (+)
    More heat and pressure drives rock transformation — turning sedimentary into metamorphic rock, or melting rock entirely into magma that becomes igneous rock.

  ○ Weathering Rate → Sediment Layers = POSITIVE (+)
    Faster weathering breaks more rock into smaller pieces, producing more sediment that accumulates in layers over time.

  ○ Sediment Layers → Fossil Preservation = POSITIVE (+)
    Thicker, faster-accumulating sediment layers bury organisms more quickly, increasing the chance of fossil preservation before decomposition.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When heat and pressure increase, what type of rock forms? When weathering rate increases, what happens to sediment layers?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Heat & Pressure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Rock Transformation.'

Here's the key question: When heat & pressure goes UP, does
rock transformation go UP or DOWN?

More heat and pressure drives rock transformation — turning sedimentary into metamorphic rock, or melting rock entirely into magma that becomes igneous rock.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Weathering Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Sediment Layers.'

Here's the key question: When weathering rate goes UP, does
sediment layers go UP or DOWN?

Faster weathering breaks more rock into smaller pieces, producing more sediment that accumulates in layers over time.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Sediment Layers' and drag an arrow
over to 'Fossil Preservation.'

Here's the key question: When sediment layers goes UP, does
fossil preservation go UP or DOWN?

Thicker, faster-accumulating sediment layers bury organisms more quickly, increasing the chance of fossil preservation before decomposition.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When heat and pressure increase, what type of rock forms? When weathering rate increases, what happens to sediment layers?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Heat & Pressure is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — MOUNTAIN BUILDER
• Maximum heat and pressure, low weathering
• PREDICT FIRST: What type of rock do you predict will form under extreme heat and pressure?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — EROSION MACHINE
• Maximum weathering, moderate other factors
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to sediment layers when weathering is extremely high?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — DEEP TIME
• All moderate, 500 million year timeframe
• PREDICT FIRST: Can a single rock go through the entire rock cycle? What would that look like?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The same atoms that make up a rock today have been recycled through the rock cycle for billions of years
• Extreme heat and pressure transform sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock without melting it
• Fossils are only preserved in sedimentary rock because igneous and metamorphic processes destroy them
• The rock cycle is powered by TWO energy sources: Earth's internal heat and the Sun's energy (driving weathering)

THE ANSWER: Seashells end up on mountaintops because sedimentary rock forms on ocean floors where shells accumulate in layers. Over millions of years, tectonic forces push that seafloor upward, and heat and pressure can transform it. The rock 'remembers' its ocean origins through the fossils trapped inside — a record of millions of years of Earth's history!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Mountain Builder. Maximum heat and pressure, low weathering.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Erosion Machine.
Maximum weathering, moderate other factors.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What happens to sediment layers when weathering is extremely high?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Deep Time. All moderate, 500 million year timeframe.
Can a single rock go through the entire rock cycle? What would that look like?

Here's what our model reveals: Seashells end up on mountaintops because sedimentary rock forms on ocean floors where shells accumulate in layers. Over millions of years, tectonic forces push that seafloor upward, and heat and pressure can transform it. The rock 'remembers' its ocean origins through the fossils trapped inside — a record of millions of years of Earth's history!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Heat & Pressure?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Weathering Rate?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Time?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Volcanic Activity — Eruptions produce new igneous rock from cooled magma and lava
   • Water Erosion — Moving water is the most powerful weathering agent, carving canyons and transporting sediment
   • Biological Weathering — Plant roots, burrowing animals, and microorganisms break down rock chemically and physically

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Three Rock Types — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Rock Cycle Process — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why are fossils only found in sedimentary rock and not in igneous or metamorphic rock?
   • If the atoms in a rock have been recycled for billions of years, what were they part of before?
   • How is the rock cycle connected to plate tectonics?
   • Why is the rock cycle called a 'cycle' if it doesn't always happen in the same order?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Volcanic Activity. Eruptions produce new igneous rock from cooled magma and lava
How would you model that?

Water Erosion. Moving water is the most powerful weathering agent, carving canyons and transporting sediment
How would you model that?

Biological Weathering. Plant roots, burrowing animals, and microorganisms break down rock chemically and physically
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Rock That Remembers Everything
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The rock cycle is one of Earth's most fundamental processes, recycling materials over billions of years. Every rock on Earth has a story to tell about the conditions under which it formed.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS2-1, MS-ESS2-3: Develop a model to describe the cycling of Earth's materials and the flow of energy that drives this process. Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils and rocks, continental shapes, and seafloor structures to provide evidence of the past plate motions.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how heat, pressure, weathering, and time interact to cycle Earth's materials through different rock types.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS2.A Earth Materials and Systems
  All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet's systems, including the rock cycle.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students explore how rocks appear stable but are constantly being transformed by slow processes that operate over immense timescales.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Rock Cycle, Sedimentary Rock, Metamorphic Rock, Fossil
□ Prepare How can a rock on top of a mountain contain seashells from the bottom of an ancient ocean discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify heat & pressure, weathering rate, sediment layers, and time as the key drivers of the rock cycle.
• Establish: Students determine that heat & pressure positively drive metamorphism, weathering positively increases sediment production, and time is essential for all transformations.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how energy inputs and surface processes cycle materials through igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic stages.
• Evaluate: Students run mountain-building and erosion scenarios to observe how different processes dominate at different stages of the cycle.
• Revise: Students add volcanic activity or biological weathering to explore additional pathways in the rock cycle.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Three Rock Types:
  Igneous rocks form when magma or lava cools and solidifies (granite, basalt, obsidian). Sedimentary rocks form when layers of sediment are compressed and cemented together (limestone, sandstone, shale). Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are transformed by heat and pressure without melting (marble from limestone, slate from shale).

• The Rock Cycle Process:
  Rocks continuously transform from one type to another. Igneous rock weathers into sediment, which becomes sedimentary rock. Heat and pressure transform sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock. Melting creates magma that cools into new igneous rock. Any rock type can become any other type — the cycle doesn't follow a fixed order.

• Fossils as Evidence:
  Fossils form when organisms die and are quickly buried by sediment before they decompose. Over time, minerals replace the organic material, preserving the shape. Fossils are only found in sedimentary rock because the heat and pressure that create metamorphic and igneous rocks would destroy them. Fossil distribution provides evidence for continental drift and past environments.

• Deep Time:
  The rock cycle operates on timescales that are difficult to comprehend. The oldest rocks on Earth are about 4 billion years old. A single grain of sand might have been part of a mountain, a beach, a seafloor, and a mountain again over hundreds of millions of years. Understanding deep time is essential for understanding geological processes.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Rocks don't change"
  Reality: Rocks are constantly changing, just extremely slowly. Over millions of years, mountains erode to plains, seafloors rise to mountaintops, and rocks transform from one type to another. The rock you hold today was once something completely different.
  Strategy: Compare time-lapse erosion images. Show before/after photos of geological formations.

• "The rock cycle goes in one direction"
  Reality: Unlike a simple circle, rocks can transform from any type to any other type. Sedimentary rock doesn't HAVE to become metamorphic before becoming igneous — it can melt directly. The 'cycle' is more like a web of possible pathways.
  Strategy: Draw the rock cycle as a triangle with arrows going in every direction, not just around the outside.

• "Fossils are just rocks shaped like animals"
  Reality: Fossils are actual preserved remains where mineral replacement has occurred atom by atom, preserving original structures at microscopic detail. Some fossils even preserve cellular structures, original proteins, and in rare cases, soft tissues.
  Strategy: Show microscope images of fossil bone with preserved cell structures visible.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How can a rock on top of a mountain contain seashells from the bottom of an ancient ocean?
Answer: Seashells end up on mountaintops because sedimentary rock forms on ocean floors where shells accumulate in layers. Over millions of years, tectonic forces push that seafloor upward, and heat and pressure can transform it. The rock 'remembers' its ocean origins through the fossils trapped inside — a record of millions of years of Earth's history!

Simulation Answers:
• Mountain Builder Scenario: With maximum Heat & Pressure, existing rocks are rapidly transformed into metamorphic rock. If heat is high enough, rocks melt into magma and become igneous rock when they cool. The model shows that Earth's internal energy drives the 'deep' part of the rock cycle.
• Erosion Machine Scenario: With maximum Weathering Rate, existing rocks break down quickly into sediment. Sediment Layers build up rapidly, compressing lower layers into sedimentary rock. The model shows that surface processes (powered by the Sun) drive the 'surface' part of the rock cycle.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why are fossils only in sedimentary rock?
  A: Fossils form when organisms are buried by sediment before they decompose. The gentle process of sediment compression preserves their shapes. Igneous rock forms from molten magma (1000°C+), which would vaporize any organism. Metamorphic rock forms under extreme heat and pressure that crushes and distorts any fossils present. Only sedimentary rock's gentle formation process can preserve biological evidence.
• Q: How can the same atoms be in different rocks?
  A: The atoms in a rock are not permanently locked in. When a rock weathers, its atoms scatter as sediment. When sediment is compressed, those atoms become part of a new sedimentary rock. If that rock is heated, it transforms into metamorphic rock — same atoms, new arrangement. If melted and cooled, they become igneous rock. The atoms cycle endlessly through different rock types over billions of years.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Geological Time Capsule
Mission: Design a system to preserve a message for 1 million years using your understanding of how rocks form, weather, and preserve materials.
Scenario: A science foundation wants to create a time capsule that will survive for 1 million years. Your geology team must use evidence from the rock cycle model to recommend the best materials, location, and protection strategy.
Introduction: Present the challenge: The Long Now Foundation wants to preserve a message for 1 million years. Your geological engineering team must recommend materials, locations, and protection strategies based on your understanding of how rocks form and weather.

Key Concepts:
• Mineral Stability: Some minerals are extremely stable and resist weathering for millions of years. Quartz, for example, barely weathers, which is why sand (mostly quartz) accumulates on beaches.
• Erosion Rates: Different environments weather rocks at vastly different rates. Desert environments with little water weather rock very slowly, while coastal environments can wear away cliffs in decades.
• Geological Stability Zones: Some areas on Earth (cratons) have been geologically stable for billions of years. These ancient continental cores experience minimal tectonic activity and are ideal for long-term preservation.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Time capsule design uses rock cycle evidence, selects appropriate materials based on mineral stability, and considers multiple weathering threats
• Proficient (3): Design references rock cycle concepts and addresses at least two weathering threats
• Developing (2): Design mentions durability but doesn't connect to rock cycle processes
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of geological preservation

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a labeled rock cycle diagram with arrows showing all possible pathways between rock types
  • Use candy or crayon shavings to physically demonstrate sedimentary layering, compression, and metamorphism
  • Sentence frames: 'When weathering rate increases, sediment layers __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how scientists date rocks using radioactive isotopes and explain the concept of half-life
  • Investigate a local geological formation and explain its history using rock cycle concepts
  • Compare the rock cycle to the water cycle — what similarities and differences exist?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate how long it would take a mountain to erode completely given a specific weathering rate in mm/year
  • ELA: Write a first-person narrative from the perspective of an atom traveling through the entire rock cycle
  • History: Research how ancient civilizations used different rock types for construction and why some buildings survived millennia

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Describe how energy and matter cycle through the rock cycle
• Use fossil evidence to reconstruct past environments
• Explain how different rock types form through specific processes

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A geologist finds a metamorphic rock that contains distorted fossil shells. Which sequence of events best explains how this rock formed?
• Constructed Response: Explain how a grain of sand on a beach could eventually become part of a metamorphic rock on a mountain. Describe each step of the journey using rock cycle processes.

REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Why are fossils only found in sedimentary rock and not in igneous or metamorphic rock?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. If the atoms in a rock have been recycled for billions of years, what were they part of before?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. How is the rock cycle connected to plate tectonics?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. Why is the rock cycle called a 'cycle' if it doesn't always happen in the same order?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. How does studying rocks help us understand what Earth looked like millions of years ago?

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Geological Time Capsule
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a system to preserve a message for 1 million years using your understanding of how rocks form, weather, and preserve materials.

SCENARIO: A science foundation wants to create a time capsule that will survive for 1 million years. Your geology team must use evidence from the rock cycle model to recommend the best materials, location, and protection strategy.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which rock type is most likely to preserve your message for a million years?
• What location would protect your time capsule from weathering and tectonic destruction?
• How does understanding the rock cycle help you predict what might happen to your capsule?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What material will you encase your message in — and what rock properties make it durable?

  _________________________________________________________

• Where on Earth would you place your time capsule to minimize weathering and tectonic activity?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you protect against heat, pressure, water, and biological degradation?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will future discoverers know what they've found and how to read your message?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Time capsule design uses rock cycle evidence, selects appropriate materials based on mineral stability, and considers multiple weathering threats
• Proficient (3): Design references rock cycle concepts and addresses at least two weathering threats
• Developing (2): Design mentions durability but doesn't connect to rock cycle processes
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of geological preservation
