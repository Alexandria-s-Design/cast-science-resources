### Title
**Your Phone's Dirty Secret — The Hidden Environmental Cost of the Device in Your Pocket**

### Overview
The average smartphone contains over 30 different elements, many classified as rare earth minerals. The environmental cost of extracting, processing, manufacturing, and disposing of these devices is enormous — and growing as global demand increases. Students investigate the driving question: What is the true environmental cost of the phone in your pocket? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

YOUR PHONE'S DIRTY SECRET

The Hidden Environmental Cost of the Device in Your Pocket.
What is the true environmental cost of the phone in your pocket?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Consumer Demand" — number of new phones purchased per year worldwide
  ○ Click "Mining Intensity" — amount of rare earth mineral extraction from the earth
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Environmental Damage" — land destruction
  ○ Click "E-Waste Accumulation" — amount of discarded electronics that end up in landfills

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"What is the true environmental cost of the phone in your pocket?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Consumer Demand' — that's external. Number of new phones purchased per year worldwide.
Click on 'Mining Intensity' — that's external. Amount of rare earth mineral extraction from the Earth.
Click on 'Environmental Damage' — that's internal. Land destruction.
Click on 'E-Waste Accumulation' — that's internal. Amount of discarded electronics that end up in landfills.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Consumer Demand and Mining Intensity are external because they represent inputs that drive the system — demand comes from consumers and mining decisions come from companies. Environmental Damage and E-Waste Accumulation are internal because they are consequences that result from those external drivers.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Consumer Demand" and drag an arrow to "Mining Intensity"
• Click on "Mining Intensity" and drag an arrow to "Environmental Damage"
• Click on "Consumer Demand" and drag an arrow to "E-Waste Accumulation"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Consumer Demand → Mining Intensity = POSITIVE (+)
    More demand for phones means more minerals need to be extracted from the Earth.

  ○ Mining Intensity → Environmental Damage = POSITIVE (+)
    More mining means more land destruction, water pollution, and toxic waste.

  ○ Consumer Demand → E-Waste Accumulation = POSITIVE (+)
    More phones purchased means more phones eventually discarded as e-waste.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When consumer demand for new phones increases, what do you think happens to mining intensity and environmental damage?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Consumer Demand' and drag an arrow
over to 'Mining Intensity.'

Here's the key question: When consumer demand goes UP, does
mining intensity go UP or DOWN?

More demand for phones means more minerals need to be extracted from the Earth.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Mining Intensity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Environmental Damage.'

Here's the key question: When mining intensity goes UP, does
environmental damage go UP or DOWN?

More mining means more land destruction, water pollution, and toxic waste.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Consumer Demand' and drag an arrow
over to 'E-Waste Accumulation.'

Here's the key question: When consumer demand goes UP, does
e-waste accumulation go UP or DOWN?

More phones purchased means more phones eventually discarded as e-waste.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When consumer demand for new phones increases, what do you think happens to mining intensity and environmental damage?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Consumer Demand is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — CURRENT TRENDS
• Normal demand and mining levels
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to E-Waste Accumulation over 10 years?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — MAXIMUM CONSUMPTION
• Lock Consumer Demand to maximum
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Environmental Damage?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — REDUCED DEMAND
• Cut Consumer Demand by 50%
• PREDICT FIRST: How does this change the other components?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• A single smartphone contains over 30 different minerals from mines across the world
• Mining rare earth minerals generates toxic waste that contaminates water and soil
• Only about 20% of e-waste is properly recycled — the rest goes to landfills or developing countries
• Reducing demand (keeping phones longer) has a bigger impact than recycling alone

THE ANSWER: Every phone requires mining dozens of minerals from the Earth, creating environmental destruction. When billions of phones are discarded, the toxic e-waste accumulates faster than we can recycle it!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Current Trends. Normal demand and mining levels.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Maximum Consumption.
Lock Consumer Demand to maximum.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Environmental Damage?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Reduced Demand. Cut Consumer Demand by 50%.
How does this change the other components?

Here's what our model reveals: Every phone requires mining dozens of minerals from the Earth, creating environmental destruction. When billions of phones are discarded, the toxic e-waste accumulates faster than we can recycle it!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Consumer Demand?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Mining Intensity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Recycling Rate — Percentage of old electronics properly recycled for materials
   • Carbon Emissions — CO2 released during mining, manufacturing, and shipping
   • Water Pollution — Toxic chemicals from mining that contaminate local water sources

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What's Inside Your Phone — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Mining Problem — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your personal technology use contribute to environmental damage?
   • Why do you think only 20% of e-waste is properly recycled?
   • Is it possible to have modern technology WITHOUT environmental destruction? How?
   • Who bears the greatest cost of smartphone production — consumers or mining communities?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Recycling Rate. Percentage of old electronics properly recycled for materials
How would you model that?

Carbon Emissions. CO2 released during mining, manufacturing, and shipping
How would you model that?

Water Pollution. Toxic chemicals from mining that contaminate local water sources
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Your Phone's Dirty Secret
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The average smartphone contains over 30 different elements, many classified as rare earth minerals. The environmental cost of extracting, processing, manufacturing, and disposing of these devices is enormous — and growing as global demand increases.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS3-3, MS-ESS3-4: Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment. Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita consumption of natural resources impact Earth's systems.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model to trace the impact of resource extraction and consumption on Earth's systems.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.C Human Impacts on Earth Systems
  Human activities have significantly altered the biosphere, sometimes damaging or destroying natural habitats.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify causal chains from consumer demand through mining to environmental damage and e-waste accumulation.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Rare Earth Minerals, E-Waste, Resource Extraction, Lifecycle Analysis
□ Prepare What is the true environmental cost of the phone in your pocket discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify consumer demand, mining intensity, environmental damage, and e-waste accumulation as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that demand drives mining (positive), mining drives damage (positive), and demand drives e-waste (positive).
• Visualize: Students build the lifecycle model showing how consumption drives a chain of environmental effects.
• Evaluate: Students compare current trends, maximum consumption, and circular economy scenarios.
• Revise: Students add recycling rate or carbon emissions to create a more complete lifecycle model.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• What's Inside Your Phone:
  A typical smartphone contains: lithium (battery), cobalt (battery), gold and silver (circuit connections), rare earth elements like neodymium (speakers/vibration motor), indium (touchscreen), tantalum from coltan (capacitors), and silicon (processor). Many of these are mined in environmentally sensitive areas.

• The Mining Problem:
  Rare earth mineral mining is extremely destructive. It involves stripping large areas of land, using toxic chemicals to extract minerals, generating radioactive waste, and contaminating water supplies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces 60% of the world's cobalt, often using child labor in dangerous conditions.

• The E-Waste Crisis:
  The world generates approximately 50 million tons of e-waste per year. Only about 20% is formally recycled. The rest ends up in landfills or is shipped to developing countries where it's dismantled by hand, exposing workers to lead, mercury, cadmium, and other toxins.

• Solutions and Alternatives:
  Strategies include: extending device lifespan (repair instead of replace), improving recycling technology, designing devices for disassembly, using recycled materials in new devices, and developing alternative materials. The 'circular economy' model aims to eliminate waste entirely.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Recycling solves the e-waste problem"
  Reality: Only 20% of e-waste is properly recycled. Even recycled electronics lose material in the process. REDUCING consumption (keeping devices longer) is far more effective than recycling alone.
  Strategy: Show the 'reduce, reuse, recycle' hierarchy — reduce is FIRST for a reason.

• "My phone doesn't affect the environment"
  Reality: Every phone requires mining tons of rock, uses energy from fossil fuels to manufacture, and generates toxic waste at end of life. Multiply by 1.5 billion phones sold per year and the impact is massive.
  Strategy: Calculate: If each phone requires 75 lbs of raw materials, how much is that for all phones sold in a year?

• "Technology is always progress"
  Reality: Technology provides amazing benefits, but it also has environmental costs that we need to account for. The goal isn't to stop using technology, but to use it more responsibly and demand sustainable practices.
  Strategy: Discuss: What's the difference between progress and unsustainable consumption?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: What is the true environmental cost of the phone in your pocket?
Answer: Every phone requires mining dozens of minerals from the Earth, creating environmental destruction. When billions of phones are discarded, the toxic e-waste accumulates faster than we can recycle it!

Simulation Answers:
• Maximum Consumption Scenario: When Consumer Demand is maximized, Mining Intensity increases dramatically, driving Environmental Damage to critical levels. E-Waste Accumulation accelerates as phones are discarded annually. The system is clearly unsustainable.
• Reduced Demand Scenario: When Consumer Demand is cut by 50% (keeping phones twice as long), all downstream effects decrease significantly. This shows that reducing consumption has a larger impact than any other single intervention.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is only 20% of e-waste recycled?
  A: Recycling electronics is expensive and complex — a single phone contains 30+ different materials bonded together. Many countries lack the technology. It's often cheaper to mine new materials than to recover them from old devices. And many people don't know how to properly dispose of electronics.
• Q: Can we have tech without destruction?
  A: A circular economy approach could dramatically reduce impact: design phones for easy repair and disassembly, use recycled materials, extend product lifespans, and ensure 100% recycling. Companies like Fairphone are already attempting this, but the economics need to change.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Sustainable Phone Program
Mission: Design a school or community program that reduces the environmental impact of smartphone consumption.
Scenario: Your school district wants to reduce its technology footprint. Design a program that balances student access to technology with environmental responsibility.
Introduction: Present shocking e-waste statistics. Show photos of e-waste dumps in developing countries. Challenge: Design a program your school could actually implement.

Key Concepts:
• Right to Repair: Laws that require manufacturers to make devices repairable, extending their useful life.
• Urban Mining: Recovering valuable materials from discarded electronics instead of mining new ones.
• Extended Producer Responsibility: Making manufacturers responsible for the entire lifecycle of their products, including disposal.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Program addresses multiple lifecycle stages, uses model evidence, and includes measurable environmental goals
• Proficient (3): Program uses model data and addresses at least two strategies for reducing impact
• Developing (2): Program mentions recycling but lacks specific evidence or multiple strategies
• Beginning (1): Program doesn't connect to lifecycle analysis or model findings

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a labeled diagram of phone components and their mineral sources
  • Use a physical phone teardown to show the materials inside
  • Sentence frames: 'When consumer demand increases, environmental damage __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Calculate the total mass of minerals needed to make every phone sold in one year
  • Research and compare the environmental policies of major phone manufacturers
  • Design a lifecycle analysis infographic for a specific electronic device

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate and graph the exponential growth of global e-waste over the past 20 years
  • ELA: Write a persuasive essay arguing for or against the Right to Repair movement
  • Social Studies: Research the human rights implications of cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Describe how human consumption of resources impacts Earth's systems
• Apply scientific principles to evaluate methods for minimizing environmental impact
• Construct evidence-based arguments about resource sustainability

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A company mines coltan for smartphone production. Which is the most likely environmental impact of increased mining operations?
• Constructed Response: Using evidence from your model, explain how increasing global smartphone demand creates a chain of environmental effects from mining to e-waste.
