### Title
**Hand Warmers and Hidden Reactions — How Atoms Rearrange to Create Heat, Light, and Everything You Use**

### Overview
Hand warmers are elegant examples of chemistry in action. The simple exothermic reaction of iron oxidation demonstrates both conservation of mass and energy transformation — making abstract chemistry concepts tangible and practical. Students investigate the driving question: How can a small packet create heat without fire, batteries, or electricity? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

HAND WARMERS AND HIDDEN REACTIONS

How Atoms Rearrange to Create Heat, Light, and Everything You Use.
How can a small packet create heat without fire, batteries, or electricity?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Iron Powder Amount" — the quantity of iron available for the reaction
  ○ Click "Oxygen Exposure" — how much air (oxygen) the iron powder is exposed to
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Reaction Rate" — how fast the iron oxidation reaction proceeds
  ○ Click "Heat Output" — the thermal energy released by the exothermic reaction

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"How can a small packet create heat without fire, batteries, or electricity?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Iron Powder Amount' — that's external. The quantity of iron available for the reaction.
Click on 'Oxygen Exposure' — that's external. How much air (oxygen) the iron powder is exposed to.
Click on 'Reaction Rate' — that's internal. How fast the iron oxidation reaction proceeds.
Click on 'Heat Output' — that's internal. The thermal energy released by the exothermic reaction.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Iron Powder Amount and Oxygen Exposure are external because they are the inputs you can control — how much iron is packed in and how much air reaches it. Reaction Rate and Heat Output are internal because they are the results of the chemical reaction between those inputs.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Iron Powder Amount" and drag an arrow to "Reaction Rate"
• Click on "Oxygen Exposure" and drag an arrow to "Reaction Rate"
• Click on "Reaction Rate" and drag an arrow to "Heat Output"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Iron Powder Amount → Reaction Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More iron powder means more reactant available, allowing a faster and longer-lasting reaction.

  ○ Oxygen Exposure → Reaction Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More oxygen allows more iron atoms to react simultaneously, speeding up the reaction.

  ○ Reaction Rate → Heat Output = POSITIVE (+)
    A faster reaction releases more heat energy per unit time, making the hand warmer hotter.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When you open a hand warmer and expose the iron powder to more oxygen, what do you think happens to the temperature?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Iron Powder Amount' and drag an arrow
over to 'Reaction Rate.'

Here's the key question: When iron powder amount goes UP, does
reaction rate go UP or DOWN?

More iron powder means more reactant available, allowing a faster and longer-lasting reaction.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Oxygen Exposure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Reaction Rate.'

Here's the key question: When oxygen exposure goes UP, does
reaction rate go UP or DOWN?

More oxygen allows more iron atoms to react simultaneously, speeding up the reaction.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Reaction Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Heat Output.'

Here's the key question: When reaction rate goes UP, does
heat output go UP or DOWN?

A faster reaction releases more heat energy per unit time, making the hand warmer hotter.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When you open a hand warmer and expose the iron powder to more oxygen, what do you think happens to the temperature?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Iron Powder Amount is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — SEALED (NO OXYGEN)
• Iron powder present, no oxygen
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Heat Output?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — NORMAL USE
• Normal iron amount, moderate oxygen
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict about Reaction Rate and Heat Output over time?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — MAXIMUM EXPOSURE
• Maximum iron, maximum oxygen
• PREDICT FIRST: How does this compare to normal use?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Iron + Oxygen → Iron Oxide (rust) — this reaction RELEASES heat
• The same atoms exist before and after — they just rearranged (conservation of mass!)
• More reactants AND more oxygen = faster reaction = more heat
• The hand warmer eventually stops because the iron runs out — a limiting reactant!

THE ANSWER: Hand warmers contain iron powder that reacts with oxygen in the air. This exothermic chemical reaction releases heat energy as atoms rearrange from iron and oxygen into iron oxide (rust) — the same total atoms, just in a new arrangement!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Sealed (No Oxygen). Iron powder present, no oxygen.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Normal Use.
Normal iron amount, moderate oxygen.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict about Reaction Rate and Heat Output over time?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Maximum Exposure. Maximum iron, maximum oxygen.
How does this compare to normal use?

Here's what our model reveals: Hand warmers contain iron powder that reacts with oxygen in the air. This exothermic chemical reaction releases heat energy as atoms rearrange from iron and oxygen into iron oxide (rust) — the same total atoms, just in a new arrangement!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Iron Powder Amount?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Oxygen Exposure?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Salt (Catalyst) — Salt speeds up the iron-oxygen reaction without being consumed
   • Carbon (Adsorbent) — Activated carbon helps distribute heat evenly and holds moisture
   • Insulation — The packaging material that controls how quickly heat escapes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Chemistry of Hand Warmers — how does this connect to your model?
   • Exothermic vs. Endothermic — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does a hand warmer stop working eventually? Where did the iron go?
   • How is rusting a nail the same chemical reaction as a hand warmer, just slower?
   • If atoms aren't created or destroyed, why does the hand warmer feel like it 'created' heat?
   • What's the difference between a hand warmer (exothermic) and an instant cold pack (endothermic)?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Salt (Catalyst). Salt speeds up the iron-oxygen reaction without being consumed
How would you model that?

Carbon (Adsorbent). Activated carbon helps distribute heat evenly and holds moisture
How would you model that?

Insulation. The packaging material that controls how quickly heat escapes
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Hand Warmers and Hidden Reactions
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Hand warmers are elegant examples of chemistry in action. The simple exothermic reaction of iron oxidation demonstrates both conservation of mass and energy transformation — making abstract chemistry concepts tangible and practical.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS1-4, MS-PS1-5: Develop a model that predicts and describes changes in particle motion, temperature, and state of a pure substance when thermal energy is added or removed. Develop and use a model to describe how the total number of atoms does not change in a chemical reaction and thus mass is conserved.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model to describe how atoms rearrange in a chemical reaction while total mass is conserved.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS1.B Chemical Reactions
  Substances react chemically to form new substances with different properties. The total number of atoms is conserved.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students trace how matter (atoms) is conserved while energy is released as thermal energy in an exothermic reaction.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Chemical Reaction, Exothermic, Endothermic, Conservation of Mass
□ Prepare How can a small packet create heat without fire, batteries, or electricity discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify iron powder amount, oxygen exposure, reaction rate, and heat output as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that both iron and oxygen positively affect reaction rate, and reaction rate positively affects heat output.
• Visualize: Students build the chemical reaction model showing how inputs drive the reaction and produce heat.
• Evaluate: Students compare sealed (no reaction), normal use, and maximum exposure scenarios.
• Revise: Students add salt (catalyst) or insulation to model real hand warmer engineering.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Chemistry of Hand Warmers:
  Hand warmers contain: iron powder (reactant), salt (catalyst to speed the reaction), activated carbon (distributes heat and retains moisture), and vermiculite (insulation). When exposed to air, the iron reacts with oxygen: 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3 + heat. This is the same reaction as rusting, but engineered to happen faster.

• Exothermic vs. Endothermic:
  Exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings (hand warmers, combustion, cellular respiration). Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings (instant cold packs, photosynthesis, cooking an egg). The direction of energy flow determines whether you feel heat or cold.

• Conservation of Mass:
  Antoine Lavoisier discovered that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. In a hand warmer: the mass of iron + the mass of oxygen that reacts = the mass of iron oxide produced. No atoms are created or destroyed — they simply rearrange. If you weigh a sealed hand warmer before and after, the mass is identical.

• Reaction Rates:
  Several factors affect how fast a reaction occurs: surface area (powder reacts faster than a solid chunk), temperature (higher temp = faster), concentration of reactants (more oxygen = faster), and catalysts (salt speeds up the iron oxidation). Hand warmers are engineered to balance these factors for consistent, safe heat.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Chemical reactions destroy matter"
  Reality: No atoms are created or destroyed in a chemical reaction — they only rearrange. The total mass of reactants ALWAYS equals the total mass of products. This is the law of conservation of mass.
  Strategy: Weigh a sealed hand warmer before and after activation — same mass!

• "Heat means something is burning"
  Reality: Exothermic reactions release heat but don't require visible combustion. Rusting, dissolving, and neutralization all release heat without flames. 'Burning' is just one type of exothermic reaction (combustion).
  Strategy: Ask: Is a hand warmer on fire? No, but it's hot. Chemistry creates heat in many ways.

• "The hand warmer creates energy"
  Reality: The hand warmer doesn't CREATE energy — it TRANSFORMS chemical potential energy stored in the bonds of iron and oxygen into thermal energy. Energy is conserved, just like mass.
  Strategy: Connect to conservation of energy from the roller coaster lesson (L05).

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How can a small packet create heat without fire, batteries, or electricity?
Answer: Hand warmers contain iron powder that reacts with oxygen in the air. This exothermic chemical reaction releases heat energy as atoms rearrange from iron and oxygen into iron oxide (rust) — the same total atoms, just in a new arrangement!

Simulation Answers:
• Sealed (No Oxygen): With Oxygen Exposure at 0%, Reaction Rate stays at zero — no reaction can occur. Heat Output remains at baseline (room temperature). This is why hand warmers come in sealed packages — blocking oxygen prevents the reaction from starting early.
• Maximum Exposure: With maximum iron AND oxygen, Reaction Rate peaks rapidly and Heat Output is very high initially. However, the iron is consumed faster, so the total duration is shorter. More isn't always better — the company wants CONSISTENT heat over 8 hours, not a burst of heat followed by nothing.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does the hand warmer stop?
  A: The hand warmer stops producing heat when one of the reactants is used up — usually the iron powder. This is the concept of a limiting reactant. All the iron has been converted to iron oxide (rust). The atoms still exist; they're just in a new arrangement that doesn't produce more heat.
• Q: Where does the heat come from?
  A: The heat comes from the REARRANGEMENT of chemical bonds. When iron atoms bond with oxygen atoms to form iron oxide, the new bonds are at a lower energy state than the original separate elements. The difference in energy is released as heat. No atoms are created or destroyed — only rearranged.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Better Hand Warmer
Mission: Design an improved hand warmer that provides consistent heat for a specific duration using your understanding of reaction rates and energy transfer.
Scenario: An outdoor equipment company wants to create a hand warmer that lasts exactly 8 hours at a comfortable temperature for winter hikers. Use your model to design the specifications.
Introduction: Open a hand warmer in class. Measure its temperature over time. Challenge: Design a hand warmer with specific performance targets (temperature range, duration, weight).

Key Concepts:
• Limiting Reactant: The reactant that runs out first determines when the reaction stops. More iron = longer duration.
• Reaction Rate Control: Controlling oxygen flow (porosity of the packaging) controls how fast the reaction occurs and how hot it gets.
• Insulation Engineering: The outer packaging affects how much heat reaches the user vs. how much escapes to the environment.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design specifies amounts, addresses reaction rate control, explains conservation of mass, and meets duration/temperature targets
• Proficient (3): Design uses reaction rate principles and addresses at least two design parameters
• Developing (2): Design mentions chemistry but lacks specific engineering specifications
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to chemical reaction principles

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a before/after atom diagram showing iron + oxygen → iron oxide
  • Use physical hand warmers with thermometers for real-time data
  • Sentence frames: 'When oxygen exposure increases, the reaction rate __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Balance the chemical equation 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3 and verify atom conservation
  • Research and compare different types of exothermic reactions used in consumer products
  • Design an experiment to test how surface area (powder vs. filings vs. nails) affects reaction rate

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Balance chemical equations by counting atoms on each side; graph temperature change over time
  • ELA: Write product instructions for a hand warmer that explain the science to a consumer
  • Social Studies: Research the history of chemical engineering from alchemy to modern materials science

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Predict changes in temperature when thermal energy is added or removed
• Describe how atoms rearrange in chemical reactions while mass is conserved
• Use models to explain exothermic and endothermic reactions

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Iron powder (10g) reacts with oxygen from the air inside a sealed hand warmer. After the reaction is complete, what is the total mass of the products?
• Constructed Response: Using the law of conservation of mass, explain what happens to the atoms during the chemical reaction inside a hand warmer. Where does the heat come from if atoms are neither created nor destroyed?

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Better Hand Warmer
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design an improved hand warmer that provides consistent heat for a specific duration using your understanding of reaction rates and energy transfer.

SCENARIO: An outdoor equipment company wants to create a hand warmer that lasts exactly 8 hours at a comfortable temperature for winter hikers. Use your model to design the specifications.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How can you control the rate of the reaction to make heat last longer?
• What factors determine how hot the hand warmer gets?
• How does the amount of iron relate to how long the warmer lasts?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How much iron powder will you use?

• How will you control oxygen flow to regulate temperature?

  _________________________________________________________

• What insulating materials will you use?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you verify that mass is conserved in your design?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design specifies amounts, addresses reaction rate control, explains conservation of mass, and meets duration/temperature targets
• Proficient (3): Design uses reaction rate principles and addresses at least two design parameters
• Developing (2): Design mentions chemistry but lacks specific engineering specifications
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to chemical reaction principles
