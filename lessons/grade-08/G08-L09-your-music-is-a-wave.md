### Title
**Your Music Is a Wave — How Sound, Light, and WiFi All Follow the Same Rules**

### Overview
Every sound you hear, every color you see, every WiFi signal your phone receives — they're all waves. Understanding wave properties reveals the physics behind music, communication, and even medical imaging. Students investigate the driving question: How does a wave carry your favorite song from a speaker to your ear? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

YOUR MUSIC IS A WAVE

How Sound, Light, and WiFi All Follow the Same Rules.
How does a wave carry your favorite song from a speaker to your ear?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Wave Amplitude" — the height/intensity of the wave from the baseline
  ○ Click "Wave Frequency" — number of complete wave cycles per second
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Wave Energy" — total energy carried by the wave
  ○ Click "Sound Perception" — what we hear — loudness and pitch

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How does a wave carry your favorite song from a speaker to your ear?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Wave Amplitude' — that's external. The height/intensity of the wave from the baseline.
Click on 'Wave Frequency' — that's external. Number of complete wave cycles per second.
Click on 'Wave Energy' — that's internal. Total energy carried by the wave.
Click on 'Sound Perception' — that's internal. What we hear — loudness and pitch.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Wave Amplitude and Wave Frequency are external because they are properties controlled by the source (speaker, instrument). Wave Energy and Sound Perception are internal because they are the resulting effects determined by those input properties.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Wave Amplitude" and drag an arrow to "Wave Energy"
• Click on "Wave Frequency" and drag an arrow to "Sound Perception"
• Click on "Wave Energy" and drag an arrow to "Sound Perception"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Wave Amplitude → Wave Energy = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher amplitude means more energy — in fact, energy scales with amplitude SQUARED (double amplitude = 4x energy).

  ○ Wave Frequency → Sound Perception = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher frequency waves are perceived as higher pitch. Lower frequency = lower pitch (bass).

  ○ Wave Energy → Sound Perception = POSITIVE (+)
    More wave energy is perceived as louder sound. The wave carries more energy to your eardrum.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When you turn the volume UP on your speaker, what wave property are you changing? When you play a higher note, what changes?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Wave Amplitude' and drag an arrow
over to 'Wave Energy.'

Here's the key question: When wave amplitude goes UP, does
wave energy go UP or DOWN?

Higher amplitude means more energy — in fact, energy scales with amplitude SQUARED (double amplitude = 4x energy).
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Wave Frequency' and drag an arrow
over to 'Sound Perception.'

Here's the key question: When wave frequency goes UP, does
sound perception go UP or DOWN?

Higher frequency waves are perceived as higher pitch. Lower frequency = lower pitch (bass).
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Wave Energy' and drag an arrow
over to 'Sound Perception.'

Here's the key question: When wave energy goes UP, does
sound perception go UP or DOWN?

More wave energy is perceived as louder sound. The wave carries more energy to your eardrum.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When you turn the volume UP on your speaker, what wave property are you changing? When you play a higher note, what changes?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Wave Amplitude is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — WHISPER
• Low amplitude, medium frequency
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict about the Wave Energy and Sound Perception?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — SCREAMING HIGH NOTE
• Maximum amplitude and frequency
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to Wave Energy at maximum settings?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — BASS DROP
• Maximum amplitude, minimum frequency
• PREDICT FIRST: How does this sound different from the high note?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Amplitude controls LOUDNESS — bigger waves carry more energy
• Frequency controls PITCH — more cycles per second = higher pitch
• Doubling the amplitude QUADRUPLES the energy (squared relationship!)
• Sound, light, radio, and WiFi are ALL waves following the same basic rules

THE ANSWER: Sound travels as a wave through the air. The speaker vibrates, creating pressure waves. The amplitude determines how LOUD (energy), and the frequency determines the PITCH. Your ear converts these waves back into signals your brain interprets as music!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Whisper. Low amplitude, medium frequency.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Screaming High Note.
Maximum amplitude and frequency.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What happens to Wave Energy at maximum settings?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Bass Drop. Maximum amplitude, minimum frequency.
How does this sound different from the high note?

Here's what our model reveals: Sound travels as a wave through the air. The speaker vibrates, creating pressure waves. The amplitude determines how LOUD (energy), and the frequency determines the PITCH. Your ear converts these waves back into signals your brain interprets as music!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Wave Amplitude?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Wave Frequency?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Medium Density — How dense the material the wave travels through is
   • Reflection — Sound bouncing off hard surfaces (echoes)
   • Absorption — Sound energy being converted to heat in soft materials

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Wave Basics — how does this connect to your model?
   • Amplitude and Energy — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How is turning up the volume on your phone related to wave amplitude?
   • Why does a bass guitar sound different from a piccolo if they play the same note?
   • Why can you hear someone through a wall but not see them?
   • How is a WiFi signal similar to a sound wave? How is it different?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Medium Density. How dense the material the wave travels through is
How would you model that?

Reflection. Sound bouncing off hard surfaces (echoes)
How would you model that?

Absorption. Sound energy being converted to heat in soft materials
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Your Music Is a Wave
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Every sound you hear, every color you see, every WiFi signal your phone receives — they're all waves. Understanding wave properties reveals the physics behind music, communication, and even medical imaging.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS4-1, MS-PS4-2: Use mathematical representations to describe a simple model for waves that includes how the amplitude of a wave is related to the energy in a wave. Develop and use a model to describe that waves are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through various materials.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model describing how amplitude and frequency affect wave energy and perception.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS4.A Wave Properties
  A simple wave has a repeating pattern with specific amplitude, frequency, and wavelength related to energy.
• Crosscutting Concept: Patterns
  Students identify the repeating pattern structure of waves and how changing pattern parameters changes energy and perception.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Amplitude, Frequency, Wavelength, Medium
□ Prepare How does a wave carry your favorite song from a speaker to your ear discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify wave amplitude, wave frequency, wave energy, and sound perception as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that amplitude strongly increases energy (squared relationship), and frequency affects pitch perception.
• Visualize: Students build the wave model showing how properties connect to energy and perception.
• Evaluate: Students compare whisper, screaming high note, and bass drop scenarios.
• Revise: Students add medium density or reflection to model material interactions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Wave Basics:
  A wave is a repeating disturbance that transfers energy without transferring matter. The key properties are: amplitude (height from baseline), frequency (cycles per second, measured in Hertz), wavelength (distance between identical points), and speed (depends on the medium).

• Amplitude and Energy:
  Wave energy is proportional to amplitude SQUARED. This means doubling the amplitude quadruples the energy. In sound, amplitude determines loudness. In light, amplitude determines brightness. This squared relationship is why a small increase in volume requires a large increase in speaker power.

• Frequency and Perception:
  Humans can hear frequencies from about 20 Hz (deep bass) to 20,000 Hz (high pitch). Frequency determines the pitch of sound and the color of light. Musical notes correspond to specific frequencies: middle C is 262 Hz, the A above it is 440 Hz.

• Wave Interactions with Materials:
  When waves encounter a new material, they can be: reflected (bounced back — echo), absorbed (converted to heat — sound dampening), or transmitted (passed through). Most materials do all three to varying degrees. Hard surfaces reflect more sound; soft surfaces absorb more.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Sound can travel through empty space"
  Reality: Sound requires a medium (matter) to travel through. Sound travels through air, water, and solids, but NOT through a vacuum. In space, no one can hear you scream!
  Strategy: Ask: If sound needs air molecules to vibrate, what happens when there are no air molecules?

• "Loud sounds travel faster"
  Reality: Volume (amplitude) does NOT affect the speed of sound. A whisper and a scream travel at the same speed (~343 m/s in air). Amplitude only affects energy, not speed.
  Strategy: Analogy: A big wave and a small wave in a pool move at the same speed — one is just taller.

• "Higher frequency means more energy"
  Reality: Frequency affects pitch, not necessarily total energy. Amplitude is the primary driver of wave energy. A loud bass note (high amplitude, low frequency) can carry more energy than a quiet high note (low amplitude, high frequency).
  Strategy: Compare: Which carries more energy — a whispered scream or a felt bass drop?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does a wave carry your favorite song from a speaker to your ear?
Answer: Sound travels as a wave through the air. The speaker vibrates, creating pressure waves. The amplitude determines how LOUD (energy), and the frequency determines the PITCH. Your ear converts these waves back into signals your brain interprets as music!

Simulation Answers:
• Screaming High Note: At maximum amplitude AND frequency, Wave Energy is at its peak (amplitude squared). Sound Perception shows maximum loudness AND highest pitch. This represents the most energetic sound wave in our model.
• Bass Drop: At maximum amplitude but minimum frequency, Wave Energy is still high (amplitude drives energy). Sound Perception shows maximum loudness but lowest pitch. The deep bass vibration carries a lot of energy but at a low frequency — that's why you can FEEL bass in your chest.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does bass feel different from treble?
  A: Bass waves have low frequency (long wavelength) and can actually vibrate your body because the wavelengths are long enough to physically move objects. High-frequency waves have shorter wavelengths that primarily affect your eardrums. That's why you feel bass in your chest at concerts.
• Q: Why does a room's material affect sound?
  A: Hard surfaces (concrete, glass) reflect most sound waves back into the room, creating echoes and reverb. Soft surfaces (carpet, curtains, foam) absorb sound energy by converting it to tiny amounts of heat. Good acoustics require the right balance of reflection and absorption.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Concert Venue
Mission: Design a concert venue or music room that optimizes sound quality using wave behavior principles.
Scenario: A music school needs a new performance hall. The architect hired your team to make science-based recommendations for materials and design to ensure great acoustics.
Introduction: Play the same song in the classroom vs. a hallway. Notice the difference? Challenge: Design a venue where music sounds amazing. Your recommendations must be based on wave science.

Key Concepts:
• Acoustic Panels: Shaped surfaces that scatter sound waves to reduce echo while maintaining volume.
• Bass Traps: Special absorbers designed for low-frequency sounds that are hardest to control.
• Diffusion: Scattering sound waves in many directions to create an even sound field.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design addresses reflection, absorption, and room shape with scientific reasoning for each choice
• Proficient (3): Design uses wave science principles and addresses at least two acoustic factors
• Developing (2): Design mentions acoustics but lacks specific wave science connections
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to wave behavior or material properties

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a labeled wave diagram with amplitude, frequency, and wavelength
  • Use a slinky or rope to physically demonstrate wave properties
  • Sentence frames: 'When amplitude increases, wave energy __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the physics of noise-canceling headphones (destructive interference)
  • Add medium density component and model how sound travels differently in air vs. water vs. steel
  • Calculate the wavelength of your favorite song's bass note using v = fλ

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph the squared relationship between amplitude and energy; calculate wavelength from frequency and speed
  • ELA: Write a technical explanation of how speakers convert electrical signals into sound waves
  • Social Studies: Research how different cultures use acoustics in architectural design (amphitheaters, cathedrals, etc.)

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Use mathematical representations to describe wave amplitude and energy relationships
• Develop models showing how waves interact with different materials
• Describe wave properties using frequency, amplitude, and wavelength

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A sound wave has its amplitude doubled while frequency stays the same. What happens to the energy of the wave?
• Constructed Response: Using wave properties, explain why a concert sounds different in a carpeted room versus a room with all hard surfaces. Include the concepts of reflection and absorption.

MISSION: Design a concert venue or music room that optimizes sound quality using wave behavior principles.

SCENARIO: A music school needs a new performance hall. The architect hired your team to make science-based recommendations for materials and design to ensure great acoustics.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which materials reflect sound? Which absorb it?
• How does room shape affect sound wave behavior?
• What causes echo and how can you control it?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What shape will your venue be and why?

  _________________________________________________________

• What wall materials will you use to control sound?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you prevent echo while maintaining volume?

  _________________________________________________________

• Where should speakers be placed for the best experience?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design addresses reflection, absorption, and room shape with scientific reasoning for each choice
• Proficient (3): Design uses wave science principles and addresses at least two acoustic factors
• Developing (2): Design mentions acoustics but lacks specific wave science connections
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to wave behavior or material properties
