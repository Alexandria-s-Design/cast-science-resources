### Title
**Superbugs: Evolution You Can See — Why Antibiotics Are Losing the War Against Bacteria**

### Overview
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent public health crises of the 21st century. The WHO has called it a 'global health emergency.' Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms behind resistance is essential for developing strategies to combat it. Students investigate the driving question: Why are bacteria becoming impossible to kill? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
8th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-LS4-4, MS-LS4-6**: Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase some individuals' probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment. Use mathematical representations to support explanations of how natural selection may lead to increases and decreases of specific traits in populations over time.

### Learning Objectives

SUPERBUGS: EVOLUTION YOU CAN SEE

Why Antibiotics Are Losing the War Against Bacteria.
Why are bacteria becoming impossible to kill?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Antibiotic Use" — frequency and dosage of antibiotic treatment in a population
  ○ Click "Mutation Rate" — rate at which random genetic changes occur in bacterial dna
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Resistant Bacteria" — percentage of bacteria that survive antibiotic treatment
  ○ Click "Treatment Effectiveness" — how well antibiotics kill bacterial infections

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why are bacteria becoming impossible to kill?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Antibiotic Use' — that's external. Frequency and dosage of antibiotic treatment in a population.
Click on 'Mutation Rate' — that's external. Rate at which random genetic changes occur in bacterial DNA.
Click on 'Resistant Bacteria' — that's internal. Percentage of bacteria that survive antibiotic treatment.
Click on 'Treatment Effectiveness' — that's internal. How well antibiotics kill bacterial infections.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Antibiotic Use and Mutation Rate are external because they are inputs from outside the bacterial population — doctors control antibiotic use and mutation rate is a natural process. Resistant Bacteria and Treatment Effectiveness are internal because they change as a result of those external inputs.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Antibiotic Use" and drag an arrow to "Resistant Bacteria"
• Click on "Mutation Rate" and drag an arrow to "Resistant Bacteria"
• Click on "Resistant Bacteria" and drag an arrow to "Treatment Effectiveness"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Antibiotic Use → Resistant Bacteria = POSITIVE (+)
    More antibiotic use creates stronger selective pressure, allowing resistant bacteria to outcompete susceptible ones.

  ○ Mutation Rate → Resistant Bacteria = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher mutation rates create more genetic variation, increasing the chance of resistance genes appearing.

  ○ Resistant Bacteria → Treatment Effectiveness = NEGATIVE (−)
    As the percentage of resistant bacteria increases, antibiotics become less effective at treating infections.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When antibiotic use increases, what happens to the percentage of resistant bacteria in the population over time?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Antibiotic Use' and drag an arrow
over to 'Resistant Bacteria.'

Here's the key question: When antibiotic use goes UP, does
resistant bacteria go UP or DOWN?

More antibiotic use creates stronger selective pressure, allowing resistant bacteria to outcompete susceptible ones.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Mutation Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Resistant Bacteria.'

Here's the key question: When mutation rate goes UP, does
resistant bacteria go UP or DOWN?

Higher mutation rates create more genetic variation, increasing the chance of resistance genes appearing.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Resistant Bacteria' and drag an arrow
over to 'Treatment Effectiveness.'

Here's the key question: When resistant bacteria goes UP, does
treatment effectiveness go UP or DOWN?

As the percentage of resistant bacteria increases, antibiotics become less effective at treating infections.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When antibiotic use increases, what happens to the percentage of resistant bacteria in the population over time?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Antibiotic Use is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — NORMAL TREATMENT
• Moderate antibiotic use, normal mutation rate
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Treatment Effectiveness over time?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE
• Lock Antibiotic Use to 100%
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to the Resistant Bacteria population?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — RESPONSIBLE USE
• Set Antibiotic Use to 30%
• PREDICT FIRST: How does this compare to the overuse scenario?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Random mutations create resistant bacteria BEFORE antibiotics are even used
• Antibiotics don't cause resistance — they SELECT for bacteria that already have it
• Overuse accelerates the evolution of resistant populations dramatically
• Reducing antibiotic use slows resistance evolution but doesn't reverse it instantly

THE ANSWER: Antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant ones alive to reproduce. Over many generations, the population evolves to be mostly resistant — creating superbugs!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Normal Treatment. Moderate antibiotic use, normal mutation rate.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Antibiotic Overuse.
Lock Antibiotic Use to 100%.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to the Resistant Bacteria population?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Responsible Use. Set Antibiotic Use to 30%.
How does this compare to the overuse scenario?

Here's what our model reveals: Antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant ones alive to reproduce. Over many generations, the population evolves to be mostly resistant — creating superbugs!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Antibiotic Use?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Mutation Rate?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Horizontal Gene Transfer — Bacteria can share resistance genes with nearby bacteria
   • Immune System Strength — A stronger immune system can fight bacteria alongside antibiotics
   • Biofilm Formation — Bacteria form protective communities that resist treatment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • How Resistance Develops — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Overuse Problem — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is it dangerous to stop taking antibiotics when you feel better but before the course is done?
   • How is antibiotic resistance an example of natural selection happening in real time?
   • Why might using antibiotics in livestock farming increase resistance in human diseases?
   • What would happen to modern medicine if antibiotics stop working completely?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Horizontal Gene Transfer. Bacteria can share resistance genes with nearby bacteria
How would you model that?

Immune System Strength. A stronger immune system can fight bacteria alongside antibiotics
How would you model that?

Biofilm Formation. Bacteria form protective communities that resist treatment
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Superbugs: Evolution You Can See
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent public health crises of the 21st century. The WHO has called it a 'global health emergency.' Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms behind resistance is essential for developing strategies to combat it.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS4-4, MS-LS4-6: Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase some individuals' probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment. Use mathematical representations to support explanations of how natural selection may lead to increases and decreases of specific traits in populations over time.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how natural selection drives antibiotic resistance.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS4.B Natural Selection
  Natural selection leads to the predominance of certain traits in a population and the suppression of others.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify that antibiotic overuse CAUSES the selection pressure that leads to the EFFECT of resistant populations.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Antibiotic Resistance, Natural Selection, Mutation, Selective Pressure
□ Prepare Why are bacteria becoming impossible to kill discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify antibiotic use, mutation rate, resistant bacteria percentage, and treatment effectiveness as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that antibiotic use positively affects resistant bacteria percentage (by selecting for them) but negatively affects treatment effectiveness.
• Visualize: Students build the resistance evolution model showing how selection pressure drives population change.
• Evaluate: Students run overuse vs. responsible use scenarios and compare the rate of resistance evolution.
• Revise: Students add horizontal gene transfer or immune system components to make the model more realistic.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• How Resistance Develops:
  Bacterial populations contain natural genetic variation due to random mutations. Some bacteria happen to carry genes that provide resistance to antibiotics. When antibiotics are applied, susceptible bacteria die while resistant ones survive and reproduce, passing on their resistance genes. This is natural selection in action.

• The Overuse Problem:
  When antibiotics are overprescribed, used for viral infections (where they don't work), or not completed as prescribed, they create stronger selective pressures. Agricultural use of antibiotics in livestock accounts for roughly 70% of all antibiotic use in the U.S.

• MRSA and Other Superbugs:
  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most well-known superbugs. It evolved resistance to multiple antibiotics and kills approximately 20,000 Americans per year. Other concerning superbugs include CRE, VRE, and drug-resistant tuberculosis.

• Mathematical Modeling:
  Resistance evolution can be modeled mathematically using population genetics equations. The rate of resistance increase depends on: initial frequency of resistant alleles, strength of selective pressure (antibiotic use), fitness cost of resistance, and population size.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Antibiotics make bacteria resistant"
  Reality: Antibiotics don't CREATE resistance — they SELECT for bacteria that already have resistance due to random mutations. The resistance genes existed before the antibiotic was ever used.
  Strategy: Ask: If I spray weed killer on a lawn and some weeds survive, did the weed killer teach them to survive?

• "Evolution takes millions of years"
  Reality: Bacteria can evolve noticeable resistance in days or weeks because they reproduce so quickly (every 20 minutes). Evolution by natural selection can be observed in real time.
  Strategy: Show data on how quickly MRSA evolved from discovery of methicillin.

• "If I feel better, I can stop antibiotics"
  Reality: Stopping early kills the weakest bacteria but leaves the most resistant ones alive to reproduce. Completing the full course ensures even partially-resistant bacteria are killed.
  Strategy: Connect to the model: What happens in a half-dose scenario?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why are bacteria becoming impossible to kill?
Answer: Antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant ones alive to reproduce. Over many generations, the population evolves to be mostly resistant — creating superbugs!

Simulation Answers:
• Overuse Scenario: When Antibiotic Use is locked at 100%, Resistant Bacteria percentage climbs rapidly within 10-20 generations. Treatment Effectiveness crashes. The antibiotics are selecting so strongly that only resistant bacteria survive to reproduce.
• Responsible Use Scenario: At 30% Antibiotic Use, Resistant Bacteria still increase but MUCH more slowly. Treatment Effectiveness declines gradually rather than crashing. There's a much longer window where antibiotics remain useful.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why stop taking antibiotics early is dangerous?
  A: When you stop early, you kill the most susceptible bacteria but leave partially-resistant ones alive. Those survivors reproduce, and the next generation is harder to kill. You've essentially trained the bacteria to resist that antibiotic.
• Q: How is this natural selection in real time?
  A: The three requirements for natural selection are variation (mutations create different resistance levels), selection pressure (antibiotics kill susceptible ones), and inheritance (survivors pass resistance genes to offspring). All three are happening with every dose of antibiotics.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Hospital Antibiotic Policy
Mission: Design an evidence-based antibiotic use policy for a hospital that minimizes resistance evolution while still effectively treating infections.
Scenario: A hospital is seeing increasing antibiotic-resistant infections in patients. The medical director needs your team to propose a new policy using evidence from your model.
Introduction: Present a scenario: A hospital reports that 40% of staph infections are now MRSA. The medical director needs your team's evidence-based policy recommendations.

Key Concepts:
• Antibiotic Stewardship: Programs that optimize when and how antibiotics are prescribed to slow resistance.
• Diagnostic Testing: Rapid tests that identify whether an infection is bacterial before prescribing antibiotics.
• Combination Therapy: Using multiple antibiotics together makes it harder for bacteria to evolve resistance to all of them simultaneously.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Policy uses model evidence, addresses multiple strategies, and includes a monitoring plan
• Proficient (3): Policy references model data and includes at least two evidence-based strategies
• Developing (2): Policy mentions resistance but lacks specific evidence from the model
• Beginning (1): Policy doesn't connect to model findings or natural selection concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide visual diagram showing bacteria generations (before/after antibiotic exposure)
  • Use color-coded tokens to physically model resistant vs. susceptible bacteria
  • Sentence frames: 'When antibiotic use increases, resistant bacteria __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research MRSA statistics and calculate the rate of increase over decades
  • Model horizontal gene transfer as an additional component
  • Debate: Should antibiotics in livestock farming be banned?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the percentage change in resistant bacteria per generation using exponential growth models
  • ELA: Write a persuasive letter to a hospital board recommending an antibiotic stewardship program
  • Social Studies: Research the global impact of antibiotic resistance on developing countries

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how natural selection can change the traits of a population over time
• Use evidence to support how environmental changes affect survival
• Apply mathematical thinking to describe changes in trait frequencies

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A population of bacteria is exposed to an antibiotic. After 10 generations, 90% of the population is resistant. Which best explains this change?
• Constructed Response: Using the concept of natural selection, explain why antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become more common in hospitals over the past 50 years.
