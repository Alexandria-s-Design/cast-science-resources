### Title
**How LeBron Turns Food Into Dunks — The Cellular Science Behind Athletic Performance**

### Overview
Every movement you make — every heartbeat, every thought, every slam dunk — is powered by ATP, a molecule produced through cellular respiration. Understanding this process reveals how food literally becomes action. Students investigate the driving question: How does a chicken sandwich become a slam dunk? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

HOW LEBRON TURNS FOOD INTO DUNKS

The Cellular Science Behind Athletic Performance.
How does a chicken sandwich become a slam dunk?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Food Intake (Glucose)" — amount of glucose available from digested food
  ○ Click "Oxygen Supply" — amount of oxygen delivered to muscles through breathing and blood flow
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "ATP Production" — amount of energy currency produced by cells for muscle contraction
  ○ Click "Athletic Output" — physical performance — speed

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How does a chicken sandwich become a slam dunk?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Food Intake (Glucose)' — that's external. Amount of glucose available from digested food.
Click on 'Oxygen Supply' — that's external. Amount of oxygen delivered to muscles through breathing and blood flow.
Click on 'ATP Production' — that's internal. Amount of energy currency produced by cells for muscle contraction.
Click on 'Athletic Output' — that's internal. Physical performance — speed.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Food Intake and Oxygen Supply are external because they come from outside the cell — food is eaten and oxygen is breathed in. ATP Production and Athletic Output are internal because they are the results of cellular processes that happen inside the organism.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Food Intake" and drag an arrow to "ATP Production"
• Click on "Oxygen Supply" and drag an arrow to "ATP Production"
• Click on "ATP Production" and drag an arrow to "Athletic Output"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Food Intake → ATP Production = POSITIVE (+)
    More glucose available means more fuel for cellular respiration to produce ATP.

  ○ Oxygen Supply → ATP Production = POSITIVE (+)
    More oxygen allows aerobic respiration, which produces ~18 times more ATP than anaerobic.

  ○ ATP Production → Athletic Output = POSITIVE (+)
    More ATP means more energy available for muscle contraction, speed, and power.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When an athlete exercises harder, what happens to their oxygen demand? Why do you breathe harder during exercise?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Food Intake' and drag an arrow
over to 'ATP Production.'

Here's the key question: When food intake goes UP, does
atp production go UP or DOWN?

More glucose available means more fuel for cellular respiration to produce ATP.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Oxygen Supply' and drag an arrow
over to 'ATP Production.'

Here's the key question: When oxygen supply goes UP, does
atp production go UP or DOWN?

More oxygen allows aerobic respiration, which produces ~18 times more ATP than anaerobic.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'ATP Production' and drag an arrow
over to 'Athletic Output.'

Here's the key question: When atp production goes UP, does
athletic output go UP or DOWN?

More ATP means more energy available for muscle contraction, speed, and power.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When an athlete exercises harder, what happens to their oxygen demand? Why do you breathe harder during exercise?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Food Intake (Glucose) is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — RESTING STATE
• Normal food intake, resting oxygen levels
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict about ATP Production at rest?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — MAXIMUM EFFORT
• High glucose, maximum oxygen delivery
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Athletic Output?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — NO FUEL
• Lock Food Intake to 0%
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to ATP Production and Athletic Output?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Food is literally rearranged into energy through chemical reactions in your cells
• Cellular respiration: Glucose + Oxygen → CO2 + Water + ATP (energy)
• Without enough oxygen, cells switch to anaerobic respiration — less efficient, produces lactic acid
• Athletes need more food AND more oxygen to sustain high performance

THE ANSWER: Food molecules (glucose) are broken down through cellular respiration with oxygen, producing ATP energy that powers muscle contraction. LeBron's chicken sandwich is literally rearranged into the energy for a dunk!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Resting State. Normal food intake, resting oxygen levels.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Maximum Effort.
High glucose, maximum oxygen delivery.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Athletic Output?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: No Fuel. Lock Food Intake to 0%.
What happens to ATP Production and Athletic Output?

Here's what our model reveals: Food molecules (glucose) are broken down through cellular respiration with oxygen, producing ATP energy that powers muscle contraction. LeBron's chicken sandwich is literally rearranged into the energy for a dunk!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Food Intake (Glucose)?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Oxygen Supply?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Lactic Acid — Builds up during intense exercise when oxygen is insufficient
   • Heart Rate — Increases to deliver more oxygen to working muscles
   • Hydration Level — Water is essential for chemical reactions in cells

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • From Food to Glucose — how does this connect to your model?
   • Cellular Respiration — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How is your body like a car engine that burns fuel?
   • Why do marathon runners 'hit the wall' and suddenly lose energy?
   • What's the connection between breathing and cellular respiration?
   • Why do athletes need to eat more than non-athletes?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Lactic Acid. Builds up during intense exercise when oxygen is insufficient
How would you model that?

Heart Rate. Increases to deliver more oxygen to working muscles
How would you model that?

Hydration Level. Water is essential for chemical reactions in cells
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: How LeBron Turns Food Into Dunks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Every movement you make — every heartbeat, every thought, every slam dunk — is powered by ATP, a molecule produced through cellular respiration. Understanding this process reveals how food literally becomes action.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS1-5, MS-LS1-7: Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how environmental and genetic factors influence the growth of organisms. Develop a model to describe how food is rearranged through chemical reactions forming new molecules that support growth and/or release energy as this matter moves through an organism.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model to describe how food molecules are rearranged through chemical reactions to release energy.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.C Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms
  Within individual organisms, food is broken down through chemical reactions that rearrange molecules and release energy.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students trace matter and energy as food molecules are transformed through cellular respiration into ATP energy and waste products.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Cellular Respiration, ATP, Glucose, Metabolism
□ Prepare How does a chicken sandwich become a slam dunk discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify food intake, oxygen supply, ATP production, and athletic output as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that both food and oxygen are needed for ATP production (positive), and ATP drives athletic output (positive).
• Visualize: Students build the cellular respiration model showing how food and oxygen become energy for movement.
• Evaluate: Students compare resting, maximum effort, and no-fuel scenarios.
• Revise: Students add lactic acid or heart rate to model anaerobic conditions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• From Food to Glucose:
  When you eat, digestion breaks complex food molecules into simpler ones. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose (C6H12O6). This glucose enters the bloodstream and is delivered to every cell in your body. An average person's body contains about 4 grams of glucose in their blood at any time.

• Cellular Respiration:
  The equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ~36 ATP. This happens in the mitochondria of every cell. The process has three stages: glycolysis (splitting glucose), the Krebs cycle (extracting electrons), and the electron transport chain (making most of the ATP).

• ATP: The Energy Currency:
  ATP is like cash for your cells. Every muscle contraction, nerve impulse, and chemical reaction is paid for with ATP. Your body produces and uses about 40 kg of ATP per day — roughly your body weight! But you only have about 250 grams at any given time, so it's constantly being recycled.

• Aerobic vs. Anaerobic:
  With oxygen (aerobic): 1 glucose → ~36 ATP (efficient). Without enough oxygen (anaerobic): 1 glucose → 2 ATP + lactic acid (inefficient). During intense exercise, muscles outpace oxygen delivery and switch to anaerobic respiration. The lactic acid buildup causes the burning feeling in your muscles.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Food gives you energy directly"
  Reality: Food doesn't power muscles directly. Digestion breaks food into glucose, which cells convert to ATP through respiration. ATP is the actual energy molecule that powers all cellular work.
  Strategy: Analogy: You can't pour crude oil into a car engine. It must be refined into gasoline first. Similarly, food must be 'refined' into ATP.

• "You only breathe to get oxygen"
  Reality: You breathe for TWO reasons: to bring in O2 (input for respiration) AND to expel CO2 (waste product of respiration). Both are equally important. Too much CO2 is toxic.
  Strategy: Show the full respiration equation — both sides matter.

• "Energy is created when you eat"
  Reality: Energy is TRANSFORMED, not created. The chemical energy stored in food molecules (glucose) is converted to ATP energy through respiration. The total energy is conserved.
  Strategy: Connect to conservation of energy from physics.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does a chicken sandwich become a slam dunk?
Answer: Food molecules (glucose) are broken down through cellular respiration with oxygen, producing ATP energy that powers muscle contraction. LeBron's chicken sandwich is literally rearranged into the energy for a dunk!

Simulation Answers:
• Maximum Effort Scenario: With high glucose and maximum oxygen, ATP Production is maximized. Athletic Output reaches peak levels. The model shows the body is efficiently converting food energy into motion through aerobic cellular respiration.
• No Fuel Scenario: Without food (glucose), ATP Production drops dramatically even if oxygen is plentiful. Athletic Output crashes. You can breathe all you want — without fuel, there's nothing to burn. This models what happens when an athlete 'hits the wall.'

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why do marathon runners hit the wall?
  A: After about 90-120 minutes of intense exercise, the body depletes its stored glycogen (glucose reserves). Without glucose, ATP production drops dramatically. The runner suddenly feels exhausted, weak, and may have difficulty thinking clearly because the brain also needs glucose.
• Q: Why do you breathe harder during exercise?
  A: Exercise increases the demand for ATP, which increases the need for oxygen (a required input for efficient cellular respiration). Your brain detects rising CO2 levels (a waste product of respiration) and signals you to breathe faster and deeper to bring in more O2 and expel more CO2.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design an Athlete's Nutrition Plan
Mission: Design an evidence-based nutrition and training plan for a student athlete to optimize their performance using cellular respiration science.
Scenario: Your school's basketball team is preparing for the championship. The coach hired your team to create a science-based nutrition plan for game day.
Introduction: Show a clip of an elite athlete performing at peak level. Ask: What did they eat? When did they eat it? Connect to cellular respiration: nutrition IS energy science.

Key Concepts:
• Glycemic Index: Foods with different rates of glucose release — fast-release for quick energy, slow-release for sustained performance.
• Carb Loading: Increasing glycogen stores before an endurance event by eating extra carbohydrates.
• Recovery Nutrition: Post-exercise eating that replenishes glycogen and provides protein for muscle repair.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan connects specific foods to cellular respiration, includes timing, and explains the science behind each choice
• Proficient (3): Plan references energy needs and includes science-based food choices with timing
• Developing (2): Plan mentions nutrition but doesn't connect to cellular respiration science
• Beginning (1): Plan is a generic food list without scientific reasoning

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified cellular respiration diagram with inputs and outputs
  • Use an analogy: glucose = gasoline, oxygen = air intake, ATP = engine power
  • Sentence frames: 'When food intake increases, ATP production __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Calculate the ATP yield from a specific meal using calorie content
  • Research and compare aerobic vs. anaerobic ATP production rates
  • Add a lactic acid component and model the 'burn' during intense exercise

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate calories consumed vs. calories burned during different activities
  • ELA: Write a scientific explanation of the cellular respiration equation in student-friendly language
  • Social Studies: Research how food science and sports nutrition have evolved in professional athletics

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Construct explanations for how food molecules provide energy through chemical reactions
• Develop models showing matter and energy flow in organisms
• Explain the relationship between environmental factors and organism growth

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. What type of process is this?
• Constructed Response: Explain the step-by-step process of how a banana you eat for breakfast provides the energy for running in gym class. Include the roles of glucose, oxygen, and ATP.

SCENARIO: Your school's basketball team is preparing for the championship. The coach hired your team to create a science-based nutrition plan for game day.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What types of food provide the best glucose for cellular respiration?
• When should an athlete eat relative to game time?
• How does hydration affect cellular respiration?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What foods will you include in the pre-game meal and why?

  _________________________________________________________

• How many hours before the game should the athlete eat?

  _________________________________________________________

• What should the athlete eat during halftime?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure whether your plan improves performance?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan connects specific foods to cellular respiration, includes timing, and explains the science behind each choice
• Proficient (3): Plan references energy needs and includes science-based food choices with timing
• Developing (2): Plan mentions nutrition but doesn't connect to cellular respiration science
• Beginning (1): Plan is a generic food list without scientific reasoning
