### Title
**Earth's Hidden Water — 97% Is Undrinkable, 2% Is Frozen. We Live on the Rest.**

### Overview
Students model the surprising distribution of Earth's water and the forces that control how much fresh water is actually available to drink. By building a cause-and-effect model of precipitation, temperature, freshwater availability, and evaporation, students discover why less than 1% of Earth's water is accessible — and how climate and geography determine which communities have enough. This lesson builds urgency around water scarcity while making the system immediately understandable.

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Water Distribution System

### Text Editor

```
EARTH'S HIDDEN WATER

Ready for a number that will blow your mind?

97% of Earth's water is saltwater — oceans, seas. You can't drink it.
2% is frozen — glaciers and ice caps. Also can't drink it.

That leaves less than 1% of all the water on Earth available as
drinkable fresh water.

ONE PERCENT. For 8 billion people.

And most of THAT is underground. And some of THAT is being used
faster than it refills. Today you're going to model where it goes
— and what determines how much is left.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Precipitation Amount" — clouds and weather control this
  ○ Click "Temperature" — climate determines how warm it is
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Freshwater Availability" — this changes based on the system
  ○ Click "Evaporation Rate" — this changes based on temperature

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Which are EXTERNAL inputs? Which are INTERNAL responses?
• Sort them before your teacher continues in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The water you drink today fell as rain. Some of it evaporated
back before anyone could use it. Let's find out how much is left.
```

### Video Script

```
"Here's a fact that most people live their whole lives not knowing:

Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is saltwater. You can't
drink it. You can't water crops with it. For most of human history,
you couldn't even get to most of it.

Two percent is frozen — locked in glaciers and ice caps at the
poles and on mountaintops. Getting warmer, but still mostly untouchable.

That leaves less than one percent. Less. Than. One. Percent.

That's all the fresh water on Earth — in rivers, lakes, groundwater,
and the water cycle — for eight billion people, all of agriculture,
all of industry, all of every living thing that needs fresh water to survive.

Today you're going to model what controls that tiny fraction.
Because it's not fixed. It changes. And understanding how it changes
matters for your city, your future, and your planet.

Look at the component panel. Four pieces of the freshwater system.

Precipitation Amount — external. Clouds and weather drop rain and
snow. We can't control that.

Temperature — also external. Climate and seasons control temperature.

Freshwater Availability — internal. This changes based on how much
rain falls and how much evaporates. This is what communities depend on.

Evaporation Rate — internal. When it's warm, water evaporates back
into the atmosphere before anyone can use it.

Sort your components. Then click Plus to add each one to your canvas.

Less than one percent of Earth's water. Let's find out who controls it.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Water System

### Text Editor

```
WHERE THE WATER GOES

Rain falls. Some goes into rivers and groundwater — that's the water
we can use. Some evaporates back into the sky before anyone gets it.
Temperature controls which happens more.

Let's map these connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Precipitation → Freshwater Availability
• Temperature → Evaporation Rate
• Evaporation Rate → Freshwater Availability

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
  ○ Precipitation Amount → Freshwater Availability = POSITIVE (+)
    More rain = MORE freshwater in rivers, lakes, and groundwater

  ○ Temperature → Evaporation Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Hotter temperature = MORE water evaporates before it can be used

  ○ Evaporation Rate → Freshwater Availability = NEGATIVE (−)
    More evaporation = LESS fresh water available
    (It's evaporating away before communities can access it)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows total: 2 positive, 1 negative
• The one negative relationship is the KEY
• Evaporation COMPETES with precipitation for freshwater availability

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Notice: Fresh water has two forces acting on it. Precipitation
ADDS to it (positive). Evaporation REMOVES from it (negative).
The balance between these two determines whether your community
has enough water.
```

### Video Script

```
"Your freshwater components are on the canvas. Now let's connect them.

Click the Connect icon in the top left.

First connection: Precipitation Amount to Freshwater Availability.
When it rains more, is there more or less fresh water available?

More rain = more fresh water. That's POSITIVE. Click the plus sign.

Second: Temperature to Evaporation Rate. When temperature goes up —
summer heat, heat waves — does more or less water evaporate from
lakes, rivers, and soil?

Hotter = more evaporation. POSITIVE again.

Third, and this is the important one: Evaporation Rate to Freshwater
Availability. When evaporation goes up, what happens to the water
available for communities to use?

It evaporates AWAY. It's gone — back into the atmosphere as water
vapor, unavailable until it rains again somewhere.

More evaporation = LESS freshwater. That's NEGATIVE. Click the minus.

Look at your model. Two forces acting on Freshwater Availability.
Precipitation is ADDING water. Evaporation is REMOVING water.

This is the fundamental competition that determines whether your
city has enough to drink.

In a cool, rainy climate? Precipitation wins. Plenty of water.
In a hot, dry climate? Evaporation can win. That's why the
American Southwest is running out.

Your model captures that whole balance in four components.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Water System

### Text Editor

```
WATCH THE WATER BALANCE IN ACTION

Precipitation adds. Evaporation takes away. One percent is what's left.
Let's see your model show the tug-of-war.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines on the graph

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BALANCE
• With normal precipitation and moderate temperature, watch
  Freshwater Availability — where does it stabilize?

STEP 3: SIMULATE A DROUGHT + HEAT WAVE
• Lock Precipitation to LOW (10%) — almost no rain
• Lock Temperature to HIGH (90%) — heat wave conditions
• Watch what happens to Evaporation Rate
• Watch what happens to Freshwater Availability

This is what Cape Town, South Africa experienced in 2018 — they
nearly ran out of water completely. They called it "Day Zero."

STEP 4: SIMULATE WINTER SNOWPACK BUILDING
• Lock Temperature to LOW (20%) — cold winter
• Bring Precipitation to HIGH (80%) — heavy snowfall
• Watch how Freshwater Availability responds
• (This is how mountain snowpack stores water for summer use)

STEP 5: SPRING THAW — TEMPERATURE RISES SUDDENLY
• Keep Precipitation low but raise Temperature back to HIGH
• Snow melts rapidly — watch the spike in Freshwater Availability
• But also watch Evaporation climb with the heat

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• Why does California's water supply depend so heavily on mountain snow?
• What happens to freshwater availability as global temperatures rise?
• Which conditions in your model create the greatest risk for communities?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your water balance system is ready. Let's run it.

Click Play. With normal conditions — moderate rainfall, moderate
temperature — watch Freshwater Availability settle into a stable zone.
Precipitation and evaporation are balanced. Enough water is making it
through for communities to use.

Now let's break it. This is the scenario that nearly destroyed
Cape Town, South Africa in 2018.

Lock Precipitation to 10%. Almost no rain. Drought.
Lock Temperature to 90%. Extreme heat wave.

Watch Evaporation Rate. It's climbing — heat is pulling moisture
out of everything. Out of rivers. Out of soil. Out of reservoirs.

And Freshwater Availability? Crashing.

In January 2018, Cape Town announced 'Day Zero' — the day the city's
taps would be turned off and residents would have to line up at
collection points for water. Four million people nearly ran out of water.

They avoided it — barely — through extreme conservation. People were
limited to 50 liters per day. For context: the average American uses
about 300 liters per day.

Now try the opposite. Lock Temperature to 20% — cold winter.
Bring Precipitation to 80% — heavy snowfall. Watch the system shift.

This is how mountain snowpack works. California depends on Sierra
Nevada snow all summer. The snowpack stores winter rain as frozen
water, then slowly releases it in spring as it melts.

Now raise Temperature rapidly — simulate spring. Watch freshwater
spike as snow melts. But also watch Evaporation climb.

This is the tightrope that water managers walk every year.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
THE 1% IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOU THINK

Your model shows the fundamental freshwater system. But the real
water crisis involves even more layers — human use, groundwater
depletion, glaciers disappearing, and communities without access.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. FIND THE TIPPING POINT
   • At what precipitation level does Freshwater Availability collapse?
   • At what temperature does Evaporation overwhelm Precipitation?
   • Map the "danger zone" where your community would be in crisis

2. FIND THE SWEET SPOT
   • What combination keeps Freshwater Availability at its highest?
   • Does maximum precipitation always win? Or does temperature still matter?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Real freshwater systems involve much more:

   • Human Water Use — agriculture uses 70% of all fresh water. Where does this fit?
   • Groundwater — pumping water from underground removes it from the cycle
   • Glaciers — as permanent ice melts, we get one-time freshwater bursts, then nothing
   • Pollution — contaminated water isn't usable even if it's "available"
   • Infrastructure — pipes, treatment plants determine who actually gets clean water

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What are the major reservoirs of fresh water on Earth?
   • What is the water cycle and how does it connect to freshwater availability?
   • How do humans use fresh water? (agriculture, industry, drinking)

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • What happened in Flint, Michigan with their water system?
   • How does desalination (making ocean water drinkable) work?
   • Which country has the most fresh water per person? The least?
   • What is the "water footprint" of common foods?

🌐 RELIABLE SOURCES:
   • USGS Water Science School: usgs.gov
   • WHO Drinking Water: who.int
   • NASA Climate Kids: climatekids.nasa.gov

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Human Water Use is a great addition — it's internal, and it has
     a NEGATIVE effect on Freshwater Availability
   • Or add Glacier Melt as an External component that temporarily
     boosts Freshwater Availability before disappearing
   • Run your new model. What does it reveal?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model shows the tug-of-war between precipitation and
evaporation. Less than one percent of Earth's water. Two forces
fighting over it.

But the real freshwater crisis has even more players.

Agriculture. Seventy percent — SEVENTY PERCENT — of all the fresh
water humans use goes to farming. Every vegetable, every grain,
every piece of fruit requires water to grow. In some regions, rivers
are completely drained for irrigation and never reach the ocean.
The Colorado River is one of them. It used to flow all the way to
the Gulf of California. Now it mostly doesn't make it.

Groundwater. There's a massive underground water reservoir under
the American Midwest called the Ogallala Aquifer. Farms have been
pumping water from it since the 1940s. It's being used about 10
times faster than it naturally refills. When it's gone — and
scientists say it WILL be gone — the most productive agricultural
region in the world has a serious problem.

Glaciers. Mountain glaciers are basically giant frozen water banks.
They store winter precipitation and slowly release meltwater in
summer. But as temperatures rise, glaciers are retreating. Right
now, glacier melt is ADDING water. But when they're gone?
The banks close permanently.

Your challenge: pick one of these — human use, groundwater, or
glaciers — and add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? What does it affect? Positive or negative?

Run it. Does the freshwater picture get better or worse?

The water managers and hydrologists who protect communities' water
supplies are trying to solve exactly what your model is showing.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💧 CAREER CONNECTION: HYDROLOGIST / WATER RESOURCE MANAGER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hydrologists study the movement, distribution, and quality of water
throughout Earth. They build models almost exactly like the one you
made today — tracking precipitation, evaporation, and how climate
change is shifting the balance. Water Resource Managers use this data
to make decisions about reservoirs, irrigation rights, and drought
preparedness for entire cities and regions.

In an era where climate change is making droughts more severe and
water distribution more unpredictable, these professionals are among
the most critically needed scientists on the planet. Cities like Cape
Town, Phoenix, and Los Angeles depend entirely on their work.

💰 SALARY: $75,000 - $110,000 per year

The model you built today — tracking what comes in vs. what evaporates
away — is the exact logic hydrology is built on. You just did entry-level
water science.

TEACHER GUIDE: Earth's Hidden Water
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson makes the abstract water distribution data of 5-ESS2-2
viscerally real by focusing on the surprising scarcity of fresh water
and the forces that control it. The Cape Town "Day Zero" case study
grounds the model in a recent real-world crisis that demonstrates
what happens when the system fails.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-ESS2-2: Describe and graph the amounts and percentages of water
and fresh water in various reservoirs to provide evidence about the
distribution of water on Earth.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: have a glass of water that represents "all Earth's water"
  — put 97 drops in a bowl (saltwater), put 2 drops on ice, leave
  1 drop for students to share
□ Review vocabulary: precipitation, evaporation, reservoir, freshwater

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "There's plenty of water everywhere" → Fresh water is extremely rare;
  most of Earth's water is saltwater or frozen
• "Rain refills everything quickly" → Groundwater refills over centuries
  or millennia, not years; once depleted, it's effectively gone
• "Water disappears when it evaporates" → Water cycles back eventually,
  but not necessarily to the same location or community

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: The 97%/2%/<1% statistic is the hook. Ask students to
  express it as a pie chart — most are shocked by the visual.
• Activity 2: The negative relationship (evaporation reducing freshwater)
  is the key insight. Ask "Is evaporation helping or hurting?" to guide.
• Activity 3: Cape Town's Day Zero is emotionally resonant and recent.
  Show the images if possible — water collection lines, restrictions.
• Activity 4: Agriculture's 70% use is a great controversy starter —
  invite students to discuss whether this distribution is fair.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "If your city was about to hit Day Zero, what would you sacrifice
  first to save water?"
• "Is it fair that some countries have abundant fresh water while
  others struggle for access?"
• "How might climate change shift where precipitation falls globally?"
• "What's the water footprint of things you eat or use every day?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Water cycle unit → How evaporation connects to precipitation globally
• Social justice → Water access disparities between communities and countries
• Engineering design → Desalination and water treatment technology

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student explain why fresh water is so scarce despite Earth
  being a "water planet"?
• Does student correctly identify the negative relationship between
  evaporation and freshwater availability?
• Did student connect the drought simulation to real-world events?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide a pre-labeled diagram of the freshwater balance
Challenge: Research and calculate actual water percentages; model groundwater depletion
ELL: Use visual pie charts for water distribution; pair numbers with images
