### Title
**The Roller Coaster Equation — How Physics Turns Height Into Speed and Screams Into Science**

### Overview
Roller coasters are elegant demonstrations of energy conservation. Every scream, every thrill, and every stomach drop is the result of energy transforming between two forms: potential and kinetic. Students investigate the driving question: How does a roller coaster turn height into speed without an engine? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE ROLLER COASTER EQUATION

How Physics Turns Height Into Speed and Screams Into Science.
How does a roller coaster turn height into speed without an engine?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Coaster Height" — the vertical position of the roller coaster on the track
  ○ Click "Coaster Mass" — total mass of the coaster car plus riders
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Potential Energy" — energy stored due to the coaster's height above the ground
  ○ Click "Kinetic Energy (Speed)" — energy of the coaster's motion — determines how fast it goes

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How does a roller coaster turn height into speed without an engine?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Coaster Height' — that's external. The vertical position of the roller coaster on the track.
Click on 'Coaster Mass' — that's external. Total mass of the coaster car plus riders.
Click on 'Potential Energy' — that's internal. Energy stored due to the coaster's height above the ground.
Click on 'Kinetic Energy (Speed)' — that's internal. Energy of the coaster's motion — determines how fast it goes.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Coaster Height and Coaster Mass are external because they are design inputs set before the ride begins. Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy are internal because they change dynamically throughout the ride based on the coaster's position.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Coaster Height" and drag an arrow to "Potential Energy"
• Click on "Coaster Mass" and drag an arrow to "Potential Energy"
• Click on "Potential Energy" and drag an arrow to "Kinetic Energy"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Coaster Height → Potential Energy = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher position means more stored gravitational energy.

  ○ Coaster Mass → Potential Energy = POSITIVE (+)
    More mass at the same height means more stored energy.

  ○ Potential Energy → Kinetic Energy = POSITIVE (+)
    As PE decreases going downhill, KE increases by the same amount — energy is conserved.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When the coaster is at the TOP of the first hill, it has maximum potential energy. What happens to that energy as it drops?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Coaster Height' and drag an arrow
over to 'Potential Energy.'

Here's the key question: When coaster height goes UP, does
potential energy go UP or DOWN?

Higher position means more stored gravitational energy.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Coaster Mass' and drag an arrow
over to 'Potential Energy.'

Here's the key question: When coaster mass goes UP, does
potential energy go UP or DOWN?

More mass at the same height means more stored energy.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Potential Energy' and drag an arrow
over to 'Kinetic Energy.'

Here's the key question: When potential energy goes UP, does
kinetic energy go UP or DOWN?

As PE decreases going downhill, KE increases by the same amount — energy is conserved.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When the coaster is at the TOP of the first hill, it has maximum potential energy. What happens to that energy as it drops?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Coaster Height is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — FIRST DROP
• Maximum height, normal mass
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Kinetic Energy as the coaster descends?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HEAVY COASTER
• Maximum height, double mass
• PREDICT FIRST: How does mass affect the speed at the bottom?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — LOW HILL
• Set height to 50% of maximum
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict about the maximum speed compared to the tall hill?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• At the top of the hill: maximum potential energy, minimum kinetic energy
• At the bottom: maximum kinetic energy, minimum potential energy — the energy TRANSFORMED
• The total energy stays the same (conservation!) — height energy becomes speed energy
• More mass means more of BOTH types of energy, but the speed at the bottom is the same

THE ANSWER: A roller coaster converts potential energy (height) into kinetic energy (speed). The higher the first hill, the faster the coaster goes at the bottom — no engine needed!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: First Drop. Maximum height, normal mass.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Heavy Coaster.
Maximum height, double mass.

Before you run it — make a prediction. How does mass affect the speed at the bottom?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Low Hill. Set height to 50% of maximum.
What do you predict about the maximum speed compared to the tall hill?

Here's what our model reveals: A roller coaster converts potential energy (height) into kinetic energy (speed). The higher the first hill, the faster the coaster goes at the bottom — no engine needed!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Coaster Height?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Coaster Mass?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Friction — Energy lost to heat as the coaster moves along the track
   • Air Resistance — Energy lost to pushing through the air
   • G-Forces — The feeling of being pushed or pulled on curves and drops

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Potential Energy — how does this connect to your model?
   • Kinetic Energy — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does the first hill of a roller coaster have to be the tallest?
   • If energy is conserved, why does a real roller coaster eventually stop?
   • How would a coaster on the Moon be different from one on Earth?
   • Why do you feel 'weightless' at the top of a hill but heavy at the bottom of a dip?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Friction. Energy lost to heat as the coaster moves along the track
How would you model that?

Air Resistance. Energy lost to pushing through the air
How would you model that?

G-Forces. The feeling of being pushed or pulled on curves and drops
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Roller Coaster Equation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Roller coasters are elegant demonstrations of energy conservation. Every scream, every thrill, and every stomach drop is the result of energy transforming between two forms: potential and kinetic.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS3-1, MS-PS3-2: Construct and interpret graphical displays of data to describe the relationships of kinetic energy to the mass of an object and to the speed of an object. Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different amounts of potential energy are stored in the system.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model to describe energy transformations between potential and kinetic energy.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS3.A Definitions of Energy / PS3.B Conservation of Energy
  Kinetic energy is proportional to mass and speed squared. Energy is conserved in transformations.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students trace energy as it flows and transforms between potential and kinetic forms throughout the system.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Kinetic Energy, Potential Energy, Energy Conservation, Energy Transformation
□ Prepare How does a roller coaster turn height into speed without an engine discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify coaster height, coaster mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that height positively affects PE, and as PE decreases (going downhill), KE increases — they trade back and forth.
• Visualize: Students build the energy transformation model showing the PE-KE seesaw.
• Evaluate: Students compare different heights and masses to see how they affect the energy balance.
• Revise: Students add friction to see why real coasters lose energy and eventually stop.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Potential Energy:
  Gravitational potential energy depends on height and mass: PE = mgh (mass × gravity × height). At the top of the first hill, the coaster has maximum PE. The chain lift does work against gravity to give the coaster this stored energy. A 500 kg coaster at 50 meters has PE = 500 × 9.8 × 50 = 245,000 Joules.

• Kinetic Energy:
  Kinetic energy depends on mass and speed: KE = ½mv² (half × mass × speed squared). Notice that speed is SQUARED — doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy. This is why the first drop feels so intense: small changes in height create large changes in speed.

• Conservation of Energy:
  In an ideal system (no friction), total energy = PE + KE = constant. At the top: high PE, low KE. At the bottom: low PE, high KE. The energy doesn't disappear — it transforms. In real coasters, some energy is lost to friction and air resistance as heat.

• Real Coaster Design:
  Engineers use these equations to design every hill, loop, and turn. The first hill must be the tallest because the coaster can never regain that height without additional energy input. Loop-the-loops require a minimum speed at the top to maintain contact with the track.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Heavier coasters go faster"
  Reality: Mass cancels out in energy calculations! A heavy coaster and a light coaster dropped from the same height reach the same speed (ignoring friction). They have different amounts of energy, but the speed is identical.
  Strategy: Demo: Drop a heavy and light ball from the same height — they hit the ground at the same time.

• "The coaster has no energy at the top"
  Reality: At the top, the coaster is moving slowly (low KE) but has MAXIMUM potential energy stored in its height. It's like a fully charged battery — the energy is there, just stored.
  Strategy: Ask: Which has more energy — a rock on the ground or the same rock on top of a building?

• "Energy is used up on the ride"
  Reality: Energy is never created or destroyed — only transformed. 'Used up' energy actually became heat through friction. The total energy of the universe stays the same.
  Strategy: Calculate: Track the total energy (PE + KE) at each point — it should be constant in an ideal system.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does a roller coaster turn height into speed without an engine?
Answer: A roller coaster converts potential energy (height) into kinetic energy (speed). The higher the first hill, the faster the coaster goes at the bottom — no engine needed!

Simulation Answers:
• First Drop Scenario: Starting at maximum height, PE is at its maximum and KE is near zero. As the coaster descends, PE decreases smoothly while KE increases by exactly the same amount. At the bottom, KE is maximized — this is where the coaster is fastest.
• Heavy vs. Light Coaster: Doubling the mass doubles BOTH PE at the top and KE at the bottom. However, since KE = ½mv², the speed at the bottom is the same! More mass means more energy, but the speed doesn't change — a key insight.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why must the first hill be tallest?
  A: The chain lift gives the coaster all of its energy at the start by raising it to maximum height. After that, the total energy can only decrease (due to friction). Since PE = mgh, the coaster can never reach a height higher than it started because it doesn't have enough energy.
• Q: Why does the coaster eventually stop?
  A: In the real world, friction and air resistance convert kinetic energy into heat. This 'lost' energy reduces the total available for PE-KE transformation. The energy isn't destroyed — it becomes thermal energy — but it's no longer useful for motion.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design the Ultimate Roller Coaster
Mission: Design a roller coaster that achieves the maximum thrill while obeying the laws of energy conservation.
Scenario: A theme park has hired your engineering team to design their new signature roller coaster. It must be thrilling but physically possible — every hill, loop, and turn must obey energy conservation.
Introduction: Show a video of the world's tallest roller coasters. Challenge students: Your design must be thrilling AND physically accurate. Every hill, loop, and turn must obey conservation of energy.

Key Concepts:
• Loop Design: The loop must have a minimum speed at the top for riders to maintain contact. This sets the minimum height for the preceding hill.
• Friction Budget: Real coasters lose about 10-15% of energy to friction per hill. Factor this into your design.
• G-Force Limits: The human body can safely handle about 3-4 G's briefly. Design transitions to stay within limits.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design obeys energy conservation, accounts for friction, includes calculations for key points, and is creative
• Proficient (3): Design obeys energy conservation and includes hills that decrease in height
• Developing (2): Design shows some energy awareness but has physics violations
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't consider energy conservation principles

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a PE-KE bar chart template for tracking energy at each point
  • Use a physical ball-and-ramp setup to demonstrate energy transformation
  • Sentence frames: 'At the top, PE is __ and KE is __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Calculate the exact speed at the bottom of a 50-meter drop using energy equations
  • Research the physics of loop-the-loops and calculate minimum speed at the top
  • Compare your model predictions to actual roller coaster speed data

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Use PE = mgh and KE = ½mv² to calculate speed at various points on the track
  • ELA: Write a physics-based review of a roller coaster explaining the energy at each point
  • Social Studies: Research the history of roller coasters and how physics knowledge improved safety

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Interpret graphs showing relationships between kinetic energy, mass, and speed
• Use models to describe how changing position changes stored potential energy
• Apply conservation of energy to predict outcomes

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A roller coaster car is at the top of a 30-meter hill. As it rolls to the bottom, what happens to its potential and kinetic energy?
• Constructed Response: Using the principle of energy conservation, explain why a roller coaster's second hill can never be taller than its first hill (ignoring external energy sources).

STEM CHALLENGE: Design the Ultimate Roller Coaster
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a roller coaster that achieves the maximum thrill while obeying the laws of energy conservation.

SCENARIO: A theme park has hired your engineering team to design their new signature roller coaster. It must be thrilling but physically possible — every hill, loop, and turn must obey energy conservation.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Why can't the second hill be taller than the first?
• What's the minimum speed needed to safely complete a loop?
• How does friction affect your design?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How tall will your first hill be?

  _________________________________________________________

• How many loops and hills will your coaster have?

  _________________________________________________________

• Why must each subsequent hill be shorter than the previous one?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you account for energy lost to friction?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design obeys energy conservation, accounts for friction, includes calculations for key points, and is creative
• Proficient (3): Design obeys energy conservation and includes hills that decrease in height
• Developing (2): Design shows some energy awareness but has physics violations
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't consider energy conservation principles
