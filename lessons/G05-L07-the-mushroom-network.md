### Title
**The Mushroom Network Under Your Feet — Trees Share Food and Warnings Through Underground Internet**

### Overview
Students model the Wood Wide Web — the underground fungal network that connects trees in a forest, allowing them to share nutrients and chemical warnings. By building a cause-and-effect model showing how organic matter and soil moisture drive fungal network activity, which in turn enables nutrient transfer between trees, students discover that a forest is not a collection of individual trees but a connected, communicating community. This recent scientific discovery combines wonder, counter-intuitive thinking, and genuine matter-cycling science.

### Cover Image

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-LS2-1**: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify mycorrhizal fungi as active participants in ecosystem matter cycling
- Model how organic matter and moisture drive fungal network health
- Explain how the fungal network enables nutrient transfer between trees
- Predict what happens to forest health when the fungal network is disrupted

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Leaf Litter / Organic Matter | External | Dead leaves and organic material that feeds the fungal network — trees produce this constantly |
| Soil Moisture | External | Water content in the soil that enables fungal survival and growth |
| Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity | Internal | How active the underground fungal threads are — connecting and processing nutrients |
| Nutrient Transfer Between Trees | Internal | How much food and chemical signals are moving between connected trees |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build the Underground Network System

### Text Editor

```
THE MUSHROOM NETWORK UNDER YOUR FEET

Here's something that sounds fake but is completely real:

Trees talk to each other.

Not with sound. Not with signals you can see. Through an underground
internet made of mushroom threads — thinner than a human hair — that
connects almost every tree in a forest.

Scientists call it the mycorrhizal network. The internet calls it the
"Wood Wide Web."

And through this network, trees can:
• Share food (sugar and nutrients) with neighbors
• Send chemical warnings about insect attacks
• Support weaker trees until they grow strong enough
• Recognize their own offspring and give them priority nutrients

A forest isn't a collection of individual trees. It's one connected community.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Leaf Litter / Organic Matter" — trees drop this constantly
  ○ Click "Soil Moisture" — rainfall controls this
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity" — how active the network is
  ○ Click "Nutrient Transfer Between Trees" — what the network enables

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Which come from the environment? Which change based on conditions?
• Sort before your teacher continues in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Underground. Right now. Beneath every forest on Earth. A network
that makes the internet look new.
```

### Video Script

```
"I need you to think about the forest differently.

When you look at trees — individual trees standing in the ground —
you think you're seeing separate organisms, right? That tree is one
thing. That tree is another.

Wrong.

Almost every tree in a healthy forest is physically connected to its
neighbors through an underground network of fungal threads. Threads
thinner than a human hair, stretching for miles, weaving through the
soil and connecting into the root systems of hundreds of trees.

And through those threads? Trees share nutrients. They pass sugar to
struggling neighbors. They send chemical alarm signals when insects
attack. Mother trees — the biggest, oldest trees — preferentially
send food to their offspring.

This is real. Scientists have proven it. And the network is run by
fungi — the same kingdom as mushrooms.

The mushrooms you see above ground? Those are just the tips of a
massive underground organism. The real action happens below.

Today you're going to model how this network stays healthy — and
what happens when it's disrupted.

Look at your component panel.

Leaf Litter and Organic Matter — external. Trees constantly drop
leaves and dead material, which feeds the fungi.

Soil Moisture — also external. Fungi need moisture to grow and
transport nutrients through their threads.

Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity — internal. How active and healthy
the network is depends on its food and water supply.

Nutrient Transfer Between Trees — internal. This is what the network
enables. More active network = more sharing between trees.

Sort your components. Add them. Let's model the forest's internet.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Underground Network

### Text Editor

```
WIRING THE WOOD WIDE WEB

The fungal network needs food and water to function. When it functions,
trees share. When it shuts down, trees are isolated. Let's map this.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Leaf Litter / Organic Matter → Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity
• Soil Moisture → Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity
• Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity → Nutrient Transfer Between Trees

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
  ○ Leaf Litter / Organic Matter → Fungal Network Activity = POSITIVE (+)
    More organic matter = MORE food for fungi = more network growth
    (Fungi break down organic matter to get carbon and energy)

  ○ Soil Moisture → Fungal Network Activity = POSITIVE (+)
    Wetter soil = MORE fungal thread growth
    (Fungi need moisture to grow and move nutrients through their threads)

  ○ Fungal Network Activity → Nutrient Transfer = POSITIVE (+)
    More active network = MORE nutrients flowing between trees
    (Active fungal threads are the literal pipes that move nutrients)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows, all positive
• The chain: Food + Water → Active Network → Trees Share

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

All positive relationships. When conditions are right for fungi,
trees thrive collectively. When conditions fail, trees get isolated.
```

### Video Script

```
"The Wood Wide Web needs two things to function: food and water.
Let's wire those connections.

Click the Connect icon.

First: Leaf Litter and Organic Matter to Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity.

Fungi are decomposers — they break down dead organic material.
Those fallen leaves? The fungi eat them. More leaf litter = more
food for the fungal network = more growth and activity.

More organic matter = more network activity. POSITIVE. Plus sign.

Second: Soil Moisture to Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity.

Fungal threads — called hyphae — grow through moisture. They move
nutrients dissolved in water. Dry soil? The threads can't grow or
transport effectively. Wet soil? They can spread for miles.

More moisture = more network activity. POSITIVE again.

Third: Mycorrhizal Fungal Network Activity to Nutrient Transfer Between Trees.

This is the payoff. Active fungal threads connect tree root systems.
Nutrients — sugar, nitrogen, phosphorus — flow through those threads
from trees that have surplus to trees that need more.

More active network = more nutrient transfer. Positive.

Three relationships. All positive. All building toward a connected,
collaborative forest community.

Here's what I want you to remember: this system evolved over millions
of years. Trees aren't just competing for light and water. They're
COOPERATING underground through these fungal partners.

The most connected trees — usually the biggest, oldest ones — are
the hubs of the network. Scientists call them 'mother trees.'
When a mother tree dies, dozens of other trees can be affected.

Now let's see what happens when we remove the moisture.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Forest Network

### Text Editor

```
THE WOOD WIDE WEB — LIVE

Your model connects organic matter and moisture through the fungal
network to nutrient transfer. Let's run it and observe what holds
the forest community together.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click "Play" in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines

STEP 2: OBSERVE A HEALTHY FOREST
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• With normal organic matter and moisture, watch Fungal Network Activity
• Watch Nutrient Transfer — are trees connected and sharing?

STEP 3: SIMULATE DROUGHT (SOIL MOISTURE LOSS)
• Lock Soil Moisture to LOW (10%)
• Watch Fungal Network Activity — do the fungal threads retreat?
• Watch Nutrient Transfer — are trees becoming isolated?
• This is what happens in severe drought: the forest's internet goes offline

STEP 4: SIMULATE DEFORESTATION AFTERMATH
• Lock Leaf Litter to ZERO (cleared land, no trees dropping leaves)
• Even with moisture, what happens to fungal activity?
• What happens to Nutrient Transfer?

STEP 5: RESTORE CONDITIONS
• Unlock both. Watch how the network recovers
• How long does it take? Is recovery instant?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• Why might a cleared forest take many years to recover even after replanting?
• How does drought affect the entire forest community, not just individual trees?
• What does this network tell you about how forests are "more than the sum of their parts"?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your forest internet is online. Let's run it.

Click Play. With healthy organic matter from fallen leaves and
adequate soil moisture, watch Fungal Network Activity. It's high —
the threads are growing and spreading through the soil.

And Nutrient Transfer? Also high. Trees with extra sugar and minerals
are sending them to trees that need more. The community is thriving.

Now let's simulate a drought.

Lock Soil Moisture to 10%. Almost no moisture in the soil.

Watch Fungal Network Activity start to drop. The fungal threads
are retreating — they can't survive in dry soil. They pull back
toward the roots they're attached to, stopping their spread.

Nutrient Transfer? Collapsing. The pipes are shutting down.
Each tree is becoming isolated — cut off from its community.

This is what happens in severe drought in forests. Trees don't
just suffer from lack of water in their own roots — they lose
their entire support network. Weaker trees, young trees, trees
in shade — they were being supported by the network. Now they're on their own.

Now restore moisture but remove all organic matter — simulate a
clear-cut forest where the trees are gone and no leaves are falling.

Watch the fungal network starve. Even with moisture, without the
organic matter to feed on, the fungi can't sustain their network.

This is why replanting a cleared forest isn't just about planting
trees. The underground network has to rebuild too — and that
takes decades.

Unlock everything. Watch the recovery. It's slower to come back
than it was to collapse. Nature is resilient, but not instantaneous.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
THE NETWORK IS MORE COMPLEX THAN YOUR MODEL

Your model captures the basics: organic matter and moisture power
the network, which enables sharing. But the real Wood Wide Web is
even more remarkable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. FIND THE MINIMUM
   • What's the lowest Soil Moisture level where the network still functions?
   • What's the minimum Organic Matter level to keep fungal activity going?
   • At what point does the forest "community" break down?

2. MOTHER TREE SIMULATION
   • Imagine locking Nutrient Transfer to HIGH even when other conditions drop
   • This would simulate a "mother tree" pumping nutrients even under stress
   • What happens to the system overall?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   The real network includes much more:

   • Tree Species Diversity — some tree species share networks better than others
   • Chemical Signaling — trees send pest-warning chemicals through the network
   • Human Disturbance — pesticides, compacted soil, and logging damage the network
   • pH of Soil — acidic soil (from acid rain) disrupts fungal growth
   • Carbon Trading — trees give fungi sugar; fungi give trees water and nutrients (it's a deal!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What is symbiosis? How does it relate to the tree-fungi relationship?
   • What is a decomposer and how do fungi serve as decomposers?
   • How does matter flow through ecosystems?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Who discovered the Wood Wide Web? (Look up Dr. Suzanne Simard)
   • What is the difference between mycorrhizal fungi and regular decomposer fungi?
   • How do trees recognize their own offspring in the network?
   • What happens to a forest's mycorrhizal network after a wildfire?

   • Nature journal (academic): nature.com

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Add "Soil pH" as an External component — it affects Fungal Network Activity
     (higher acidity = less fungal activity, so this is a NEGATIVE relationship)
   • This models how acid rain affects forest health
   • Run it. Does adding acid to the soil affect nutrient sharing?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model shows how organic matter and moisture drive the underground
network that keeps forests connected. But the real Wood Wide Web is
even more mind-bending.

The scientist who discovered this network — Dr. Suzanne Simard,
a Canadian forest ecologist — spent years getting laughed at. In
the 1990s, the idea that trees communicated and shared resources
was too weird for mainstream science to accept.

Then she proved it. She injected radioactive carbon into one tree
and traced it moving through the fungal network into neighboring
trees. The carbon traveled. The trees were sharing. The network was real.

Now here's the part that might surprise you most: it's not a charity.
It's a deal.

Trees give fungi sugar — the glucose they make from photosynthesis.
Fungi give trees water and nutrients — especially phosphorus and
nitrogen that trees can't easily get on their own. Both sides benefit.
Scientists call this mutualism — mutual benefit.

And fungi are incredibly selective about their partners. Different tree
species connect to different fungi. Some species share resources freely.
Others are more selfish. The network isn't perfectly equal.

Here's your extension: add Soil pH as an external component.

Acid rain — caused by air pollution — makes soil acidic. Acidic soil
damages mycorrhizal fungi. When pH goes too low, fungal network
activity drops.

Connect Soil pH to Fungal Network Activity as a POSITIVE relationship
— higher pH (less acidic) = healthier network. Or frame it as acidity
being NEGATIVE.

Run it. What happens to Nutrient Transfer when acid rain damages the network?

This is exactly how acid rain threatened European and North American
forests in the 1970s and 80s — it killed the underground network.

What does YOUR expanded forest model reveal?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🍄 CAREER CONNECTION: MYCOLOGIST / FOREST ECOLOGIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Mycologists study fungi — everything from the edible mushrooms on your
pizza to the microscopic mycorrhizal threads holding forests together.
They're discovering new species, unlocking medical applications of fungi,
and learning how the Wood Wide Web functions as forests face climate stress.

Forest Ecologists study the systems that make forests work — including
the underground networks you modeled today. Dr. Suzanne Simard, the
scientist who proved the Wood Wide Web exists, is one of the most
celebrated ecologists of the 21st century. Her research changed how
forestry companies manage logging practices and how conservation efforts
protect "mother trees" as network hubs.

💰 SALARY: $55,000 - $90,000 per year

The model you built today — organic matter and moisture → fungal network →
nutrient transfer — is the framework forest ecologists use to assess
forest health and predict how forests will respond to climate change.
You're doing real ecological modeling.

TEACHER GUIDE: The Mushroom Network Under Your Feet
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson uses the genuinely surprising discovery of the mycorrhizal
network to make matter cycling viscerally real. The "Wood Wide Web"
framing resonates deeply with students who understand networks and
internet analogies. Dr. Suzanne Simard's story also provides a
powerful example of a scientist who persisted when the establishment
rejected her findings.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-LS2-1: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among
plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: Show clip from "Fantastic Fungi" documentary (2019)
□ Review vocabulary: fungi, mycorrhizal, mutualism, decomposer
□ Consider showing a piece of mushroom to illustrate that the
  mushroom "cap" is just the tip of a massive underground organism

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Mushrooms are plants" → Fungi are their own kingdom — neither
  plant nor animal, with unique properties
• "Fungi just decompose things" → Mycorrhizal fungi are partners to
  living trees, not just decomposers
• "Trees compete and don't cooperate" → The Wood Wide Web shows
  both competition AND cooperation happen simultaneously in forests

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: The "trees talk to each other" opening creates immediate
  engagement. Ask students "What do you think they 'say'?" before revealing.
• Activity 2: The "mutualism deal" framing helps students understand
  why fungi cooperate — it's not altruistic, it's mutually beneficial.
• Activity 3: The drought scenario is emotionally compelling — make sure
  students understand it's not just individual trees suffering but the
  entire community losing its connection.
• Activity 4: Dr. Suzanne Simard's story is a great role model moment —
  a woman scientist whose counterintuitive discovery changed a field.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "If trees cooperate underground, does that change how you think about
  forests? Are trees individuals or community members?"
• "Why might a forest take decades to recover from logging even if
  you plant new trees right away?"
• "What does the tree-fungi relationship teach us about cooperation vs.
  competition in nature?"
• "How is the mycorrhizal network similar to and different from the internet?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Matter cycling → Fungi as decomposers AND as network builders
• Human impact → Logging practices and their effect on the underground network
• Symbiosis → Different types of mutually beneficial relationships in nature

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student explain how organic matter and moisture affect the fungal network?
• Does student correctly identify all positive relationships in the model?
• Did student connect the drought simulation to real forest ecology consequences?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide a diagram of the mutualism relationship with arrows labeled
Challenge: Research how different tree species participate differently in networks; model this
ELL: Use the "internet analogy" — compare to actual internet infrastructure they know
