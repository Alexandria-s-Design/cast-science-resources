### Title
**The Concussion Problem — Why Helmets Can't Stop Your Brain from Slamming Into Your Skull**

### Overview
Concussions are one of the most significant health concerns in contact sports. Understanding the physics of collisions — force, impulse, and deceleration — is essential for designing better protective equipment and safer sports rules. Students investigate the driving question: Why do football players still get concussions even while wearing helmets? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
8th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-PS2-1, MS-PS2-2**: Apply Newton's Third Law to design a solution to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects. Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object's motion depends on the sum of the forces acting on the object and the mass of the object.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply Newton's Laws of Motion to explain what happens during a collision
- Model how force, mass, and acceleration are related in impact scenarios
- Predict how changing collision speed or mass affects the force of impact
- Evaluate helmet designs based on force reduction principles

THE CONCUSSION PROBLEM

Why Helmets Can't Stop Your Brain from Slamming Into Your Skull.
Why do football players still get concussions even while wearing helmets?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Collision Speed" — how fast the player is moving at the moment of impact
  ○ Click "Player Mass" — the combined mass of the player and equipment
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Impact Force" — the force experienced during the collision
  ○ Click "Brain Acceleration" — how rapidly the brain decelerates inside the skull

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why do football players still get concussions even while wearing helmets?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Collision Speed' — that's external. How fast the player is moving at the moment of impact.
Click on 'Player Mass' — that's external. The combined mass of the player and equipment.
Click on 'Impact Force' — that's internal. The force experienced during the collision.
Click on 'Brain Acceleration' — that's internal. How rapidly the brain decelerates inside the skull.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Collision Speed and Player Mass are external because they exist before the collision happens — they are the inputs to the impact event. Impact Force and Brain Acceleration are internal because they are produced by the collision itself.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Collision Speed" and drag an arrow to "Impact Force"
• Click on "Player Mass" and drag an arrow to "Impact Force"
• Click on "Impact Force" and drag an arrow to "Brain Acceleration"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Collision Speed → Impact Force = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher speed means more kinetic energy must be absorbed, creating larger forces during the collision.

  ○ Player Mass → Impact Force = POSITIVE (+)
    More mass at the same speed means more momentum to change, resulting in higher forces.

  ○ Impact Force → Brain Acceleration = POSITIVE (+)
    Greater force on the skull causes greater deceleration of the brain inside, increasing concussion risk.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When collision speed increases, what do you think happens to the force experienced by the brain inside the helmet?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Collision Speed' and drag an arrow
over to 'Impact Force.'

Here's the key question: When collision speed goes UP, does
impact force go UP or DOWN?

Higher speed means more kinetic energy must be absorbed, creating larger forces during the collision.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Player Mass' and drag an arrow
over to 'Impact Force.'

Here's the key question: When player mass goes UP, does
impact force go UP or DOWN?

More mass at the same speed means more momentum to change, resulting in higher forces.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Impact Force' and drag an arrow
over to 'Brain Acceleration.'

Here's the key question: When impact force goes UP, does
brain acceleration go UP or DOWN?

Greater force on the skull causes greater deceleration of the brain inside, increasing concussion risk.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When collision speed increases, what do you think happens to the force experienced by the brain inside the helmet?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Collision Speed is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — JOGGING SPEED
• 5 mph collision, normal mass
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Impact Force?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — FULL SPRINT
• Lock Collision Speed to 20 mph
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Brain Acceleration?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — HEAVIER PLAYER
• Double Player Mass at 15 mph
• PREDICT FIRST: How does mass affect Impact Force compared to speed?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Force increases dramatically with speed — doubling speed more than doubles the force
• Helmets reduce force by EXTENDING the time of impact (impulse), not by blocking it
• The brain floats in fluid inside the skull — it keeps moving when the skull stops
• No helmet can eliminate concussion risk because the brain will always decelerate during impact

THE ANSWER: During a collision, the skull stops suddenly but the brain keeps moving (Newton's First Law), slamming into the skull. Helmets extend the collision time to reduce force, but can't prevent the brain from decelerating inside the skull!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Jogging Speed. 5 mph collision, normal mass.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Full Sprint.
Lock Collision Speed to 20 mph.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Brain Acceleration?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Heavier Player. Double Player Mass at 15 mph.
How does mass affect Impact Force compared to speed?

Here's what our model reveals: During a collision, the skull stops suddenly but the brain keeps moving (Newton's First Law), slamming into the skull. Helmets extend the collision time to reduce force, but can't prevent the brain from decelerating inside the skull!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Collision Speed?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Player Mass?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Padding Thickness — Thicker padding extends the time of impact, reducing peak force
   • Neck Strength — Stronger neck muscles help stabilize the head during impact
   • Impact Angle — Glancing blows transfer less force than head-on collisions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Newton's Laws in Collisions — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Concussion Mechanism — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why can't any helmet completely prevent concussions?
   • How does Newton's First Law explain what happens to the brain during a collision?
   • Why is a 20 mph collision so much more dangerous than a 10 mph collision?
   • How is an egg drop contest similar to designing a better helmet?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Padding Thickness. Thicker padding extends the time of impact, reducing peak force
How would you model that?

Neck Strength. Stronger neck muscles help stabilize the head during impact
How would you model that?

Impact Angle. Glancing blows transfer less force than head-on collisions
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Concussion Problem
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Concussions are one of the most significant health concerns in contact sports. Understanding the physics of collisions — force, impulse, and deceleration — is essential for designing better protective equipment and safer sports rules.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS2-1, MS-PS2-2: Apply Newton's Third Law to design a solution to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects. Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object's motion depends on the sum of the forces acting on the object and the mass of the object.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model to describe how force, mass, and acceleration interact during collisions.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS2.A Forces and Motion
  The motion of an object is determined by the sum of the forces acting on it. Newton's Third Law applies to all interactions.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify causal relationships between collision speed, force magnitude, and brain injury severity.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Newton's Third Law, Impulse, Concussion, Deceleration
□ Prepare Why do football players still get concussions even while wearing helmets discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify collision speed, player mass, impact force, and brain acceleration as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that speed strongly increases force (positive), mass moderately increases force (positive), and force increases brain acceleration (positive).
• Visualize: Students build the collision model showing how inputs translate to brain injury risk.
• Evaluate: Students compare low-speed vs. high-speed and light vs. heavy player scenarios.
• Revise: Students add padding thickness to model how helmets reduce peak force.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Newton's Laws in Collisions:
  First Law (Inertia): The brain tends to keep moving when the skull suddenly stops. Second Law (F=ma): Force equals mass times acceleration — more speed means more deceleration force. Third Law: During a collision, both objects experience equal and opposite forces, regardless of size difference.

• The Concussion Mechanism:
  The brain floats in cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull. During a sudden deceleration, the brain continues moving forward and impacts the inside of the skull. This causes bruising, stretching of nerve fibers, and chemical changes that constitute a concussion. The brain can also bounce and hit the back of the skull (coup-contrecoup injury).

• Impulse and Helmets:
  Impulse = Force × Time. A given change in momentum can happen with a BIG force over a SHORT time, or a SMALLER force over a LONGER time. Helmets work by crushing or deforming, which EXTENDS the collision time. This reduces the peak force. It's the same physics behind crumple zones in cars and air bags.

• The Speed Problem:
  Kinetic energy = ½mv². Because speed is SQUARED, doubling speed QUADRUPLES the kinetic energy that must be absorbed during the collision. A player running at 20 mph has 4x the kinetic energy of one running at 10 mph. This is why high-speed collisions are so much more dangerous.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Helmets prevent concussions"
  Reality: Helmets reduce skull fractures and some force, but CANNOT prevent concussions because the brain still decelerates inside the skull. No amount of external padding can stop internal brain movement.
  Strategy: Demo: Shake a ball in a jar of water. The jar stops but the ball keeps moving. That's your brain.

• "Bigger players get fewer concussions"
  Reality: Bigger players generate and receive LARGER forces due to greater mass and momentum. While a bigger neck may help stabilize the head, overall concussion risk isn't lower for larger players.
  Strategy: Show that F=ma means more mass = more force at the same speed.

• "Speed and force are directly proportional"
  Reality: Force in a collision relates to KINETIC ENERGY, which scales with speed SQUARED. Doubling speed quadruples the force, not just doubles it. This non-linear relationship is why high-speed collisions are so much more dangerous.
  Strategy: Graph KE vs. speed: 5 mph = 25 units, 10 mph = 100 units, 20 mph = 400 units.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do football players still get concussions even while wearing helmets?
Answer: During a collision, the skull stops suddenly but the brain keeps moving (Newton's First Law), slamming into the skull. Helmets extend the collision time to reduce force, but can't prevent the brain from decelerating inside the skull!

Simulation Answers:
• Full Sprint Scenario: At 20 mph, Impact Force is dramatically higher than at 5 mph — roughly 16 times higher because kinetic energy scales with speed squared. Brain Acceleration reaches dangerous levels. This shows why high-speed collisions are so much more dangerous.
• Heavy Player Scenario: Doubling mass at the same speed doubles the Impact Force. However, the relationship between speed and force is much steeper than between mass and force. Reducing speed is more effective than reducing mass for preventing concussions.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why can't helmets prevent concussions?
  A: A helmet can reduce the force on the skull by extending the collision time (impulse). But the brain is floating INSIDE the skull. When the skull suddenly decelerates, the brain keeps moving (Newton's First Law) and impacts the skull wall. No external padding can prevent this internal deceleration.
• Q: Why is doubling speed worse than doubling mass?
  A: Kinetic energy = ½mv². Speed is SQUARED, so doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy. Doubling mass only doubles KE. In a collision at 20 mph vs. 10 mph, the force isn't just twice as bad — it's roughly 4 times worse. This is why speed reduction rules are more effective than weight limits.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Better Helmet
Mission: Design a helmet that minimizes brain acceleration during impacts using the principles from your model.
Scenario: A sports equipment company has hired your team to improve their football helmet design. You must use physics principles to explain why your design reduces concussion risk.
Introduction: Show slow-motion footage of a football collision. Present challenge: A company hired your team to design a better helmet. You must explain the physics behind your design.

Key Concepts:
• Crumple Zones: Materials that deform on impact, extending the collision time and reducing peak force.
• Multi-Layer Design: Different material layers that absorb different impact speeds (hard outer shell + soft inner padding).
• Rotational Protection: Systems like MIPS that allow the helmet shell to rotate slightly, reducing rotational forces on the brain.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design uses impulse principles, identifies specific materials, explains physics behind each feature, and addresses trade-offs
• Proficient (3): Design references force reduction and includes at least two physics-based features
• Developing (2): Design mentions protection but lacks specific physics reasoning
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to force, impulse, or Newton's Laws

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a force vs. time graph template showing how padding extends collision time
  • Use egg drop activity as physical analogy for brain protection
  • Sentence frames: 'When collision speed doubles, impact force __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Calculate the force of a 100 kg player stopping from 20 mph in 0.01 seconds vs. 0.1 seconds
  • Research MIPS technology and add rotational force component to model
  • Compare concussion rates across sports with different collision speeds

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate force, impulse, and kinetic energy for different collision scenarios using F=ma and KE=½mv²
  • ELA: Write a research paper on the ethical debate about contact sports and brain injury
  • Social Studies: Research how concussion awareness has changed sports rules and culture over the past 20 years

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Apply Newton's Third Law to analyze forces during a collision
• Plan an investigation to show how mass and force affect motion
• Design a solution that applies force and motion principles

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Two football players collide head-on. Player A (100 kg) is running at 5 m/s. Player B (80 kg) is running at 6 m/s. According to Newton's Third Law, which statement is correct about the forces during the collision?
• Constructed Response: Explain why doubling the speed of a collision is more dangerous than doubling the mass of a player. Use the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Better Helmet
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a helmet that minimizes brain acceleration during impacts using the principles from your model.

SCENARIO: A sports equipment company has hired your team to improve their football helmet design. You must use physics principles to explain why your design reduces concussion risk.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What physical principle makes current helmets work?
• How could you increase the time of impact to reduce force?
• What materials absorb energy best?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What padding materials and thickness will you use?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will your design extend the time of impact?

  _________________________________________________________

• What's the trade-off between protection and weight/comfort?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you test your helmet design?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design uses impulse principles, identifies specific materials, explains physics behind each feature, and addresses trade-offs
• Proficient (3): Design references force reduction and includes at least two physics-based features
• Developing (2): Design mentions protection but lacks specific physics reasoning
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to force, impulse, or Newton's Laws
