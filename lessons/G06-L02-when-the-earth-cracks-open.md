### Title
**When the Earth Cracks Open — The Powerful Forces That Shape Our Planet's Surface**

### Overview
Plate tectonics is the grand unifying theory of geology. It explains earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ocean floor spreading, and even the distribution of fossils across continents. Students investigate the driving question: Why do earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places over and over again? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

WHEN THE EARTH CRACKS OPEN

The Powerful Forces That Shape Our Planet's Surface.
Why do earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places over and over again?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Mantle Heat" — the thermal energy from earth's core that drives convection currents in the mantle
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Plate Movement Speed" — how fast tectonic plates move relative to each other
  ○ Click "Rock Density" — how heavy and compressed the rock is — denser rock sinks
  ○ Click "Boundary Friction" — the resistance created when two plates grind against each other at their boundary

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why do earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places over and over again?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Plate Movement Speed' — that's internal. How fast tectonic plates move relative to each other.
Click on 'Mantle Heat' — that's external. The thermal energy from Earth's core that drives convection currents in the mantle.
Click on 'Rock Density' — that's internal. How heavy and compressed the rock is — denser rock sinks.
Click on 'Boundary Friction' — that's internal. The resistance created when two plates grind against each other at their boundary.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Mantle Heat is external because it originates from Earth's core — a source outside the plate system itself. Plate Movement Speed, Rock Density, and Boundary Friction are internal because they are properties of the plates themselves that respond to mantle heat and each other.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Mantle Heat" and drag an arrow to "Plate Movement Speed"
• Click on "Plate Movement Speed" and drag an arrow to "Boundary Friction"
• Click on "Boundary Friction" and drag an arrow to "Earthquake Intensity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Mantle Heat → Plate Movement Speed = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher mantle heat creates stronger convection currents, which push plates faster. The hotter the mantle, the more energy drives plate motion.

  ○ Plate Movement Speed → Boundary Friction = POSITIVE (+)
    Faster-moving plates create more friction at boundaries where they meet. More speed means more grinding force.

  ○ Boundary Friction → Earthquake Intensity = POSITIVE (+)
    More friction at a boundary means more energy builds up before release. When locked plates finally slip, the accumulated energy produces larger, more destructive earthquakes.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When mantle heat increases, what happens to plate movement speed? Does more friction at a boundary make earthquakes more or less powerful?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Mantle Heat' and drag an arrow
over to 'Plate Movement Speed.'

Here's the key question: When mantle heat goes UP, does
plate movement speed go UP or DOWN?

Higher mantle heat creates stronger convection currents, which push plates faster. The hotter the mantle, the more energy drives plate motion.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Plate Movement Speed' and drag an arrow
over to 'Boundary Friction.'

Here's the key question: When plate movement speed goes UP, does
boundary friction go UP or DOWN?

Faster-moving plates create more friction at boundaries where they meet. More speed means more grinding force.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Boundary Friction' and drag an arrow
over to 'Earthquake Intensity.'

Here's the key question: When boundary friction goes UP, does
earthquake intensity go UP or DOWN?

More friction at a boundary means more energy builds up before release. When locked plates finally slip, the accumulated energy produces larger, more destructive earthquakes.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When mantle heat increases, what happens to plate movement speed? Does more friction at a boundary make earthquakes more or less powerful?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Mantle Heat is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — SLOW DRIFT
• Low mantle heat, slow plate movement
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to earthquake frequency when plates move slowly?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HEAT SURGE
• Lock Mantle Heat to maximum
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Plate Movement Speed when mantle heat is extreme?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — FRICTION LOCKUP
• Set Boundary Friction to maximum
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens when friction locks plates together for a long time?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Earthquakes and volcanoes cluster along plate boundaries — they're not random at all
• Higher mantle heat drives faster convection currents, pushing plates faster
• More boundary friction means energy builds up longer — resulting in BIGGER earthquakes when it finally releases
• The densest plates get pushed under lighter plates (subduction), creating deep ocean trenches and volcanoes

THE ANSWER: Earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places because that's where tectonic plates meet. The boundaries between plates are zones of enormous stress, and the heat from Earth's interior keeps pushing plates together, apart, or sideways — creating predictable patterns of geological activity.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Slow Drift. Low mantle heat, slow plate movement.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Heat Surge.
Lock Mantle Heat to maximum.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Plate Movement Speed when mantle heat is extreme?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Friction Lockup. Set Boundary Friction to maximum.
What do you predict happens when friction locks plates together for a long time?

Here's what our model reveals: Earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places because that's where tectonic plates meet. The boundaries between plates are zones of enormous stress, and the heat from Earth's interior keeps pushing plates together, apart, or sideways — creating predictable patterns of geological activity.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Mantle Heat?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Magma Pressure — The buildup of molten rock beneath the surface that can cause volcanic eruptions
   • Water Content — Water in rock lowers its melting point, affecting where magma forms
   • Plate Thickness — Thicker plates resist bending while thinner plates are more flexible

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Earth's Layers — how does this connect to your model?
   • Convection Drives Plates — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why do earthquakes and volcanoes form a 'Ring of Fire' around the Pacific Ocean?
   • How does friction at a plate boundary actually CAUSE bigger earthquakes, not smaller ones?
   • If tectonic plates move so slowly (cm/year), how can they cause such violent events?
   • What would Earth's surface look like if there were no tectonic plates?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Magma Pressure. The buildup of molten rock beneath the surface that can cause volcanic eruptions
How would you model that?

Water Content. Water in rock lowers its melting point, affecting where magma forms
How would you model that?

Plate Thickness. Thicker plates resist bending while thinner plates are more flexible
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: When the Earth Cracks Open
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Plate tectonics is the grand unifying theory of geology. It explains earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ocean floor spreading, and even the distribution of fossils across continents.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS2-2: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how geoscience processes have changed Earth's surface at varying time and spatial scales.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how mantle heat, plate speed, rock density, and friction interact to produce geological events.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS2.B Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions
  The movement of tectonic plates is driven by convection in the mantle and results in continental drift, earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students explore how Earth's surface appears stable but is constantly changing due to slow, powerful tectonic forces — and how small changes build up to dramatic events.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Tectonic Plate, Convection Current, Plate Boundary, Seismic Wave
□ Prepare Why do earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places over and over again discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify plate movement speed, mantle heat, rock density, and boundary friction as the key components of the tectonic system.
• Establish: Students determine that mantle heat positively drives plate movement, while boundary friction negatively affects smooth plate motion but positively affects earthquake intensity when released.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how heat-driven plate movement interacts with friction to produce patterns of geological events.
• Evaluate: Students run scenarios comparing low friction (frequent small quakes) vs. high friction (rare but massive quakes) to understand earthquake patterns.
• Revise: Students add magma pressure or water content to model volcanic activity alongside earthquakes.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Earth's Layers:
  Earth consists of the crust (thin outer layer), mantle (thick semi-solid layer), outer core (liquid iron), and inner core (solid iron). The crust and uppermost mantle form the lithosphere, which is broken into tectonic plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere below.

• Convection Drives Plates:
  Heat from Earth's core and radioactive decay in the mantle creates convection currents — huge circular flows of rock that rise when hot and sink when cool. These currents drag tectonic plates along, causing them to move 2-15 cm per year. This slow movement is responsible for all major geological features.

• Types of Plate Boundaries:
  Divergent boundaries: plates move apart, creating new crust (mid-ocean ridges). Convergent boundaries: plates collide, creating mountains or subduction zones. Transform boundaries: plates slide past each other, creating earthquake faults like the San Andreas. Each type produces different geological hazards.

• The Ring of Fire:
  About 75% of the world's volcanoes and 90% of earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire — the boundaries of the Pacific Plate. This zone stretches from New Zealand through Japan, across Alaska, and down the west coast of the Americas. It's the most geologically active zone on Earth.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "The ground is solid and doesn't move"
  Reality: Earth's surface is made of plates that are constantly moving, just very slowly (a few cm/year). Over millions of years, this movement reshapes continents, builds mountains, and opens oceans. We don't feel it because it's too slow.
  Strategy: Demo: Slowly push two pieces of paper together on a desk — they buckle up like mountains forming.

• "Earthquakes happen randomly"
  Reality: Earthquakes follow tectonic plate boundaries with remarkable precision. 90% of earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire. If you plot earthquake locations on a map, they trace plate boundaries perfectly.
  Strategy: Show an earthquake map and a plate boundary map side by side — they match almost exactly.

• "Volcanoes and earthquakes aren't related"
  Reality: Both are caused by tectonic plate interactions. At convergent boundaries, subduction creates both deep earthquakes and volcanic chains. The same forces that cause one cause the other.
  Strategy: Show the Ring of Fire map with both earthquake and volcano locations — they overlap along plate boundaries.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places over and over again?
Answer: Earthquakes and volcanoes happen in the same places because that's where tectonic plates meet. The boundaries between plates are zones of enormous stress, and the heat from Earth's interior keeps pushing plates together, apart, or sideways — creating predictable patterns of geological activity.

Simulation Answers:
• Heat Surge Scenario: When Mantle Heat is locked at maximum, Plate Movement Speed increases significantly. This drives more geological activity at boundaries. The model shows that more heat = faster plates = more frequent boundary interactions.
• Friction Lockup Scenario: At maximum Boundary Friction, energy accumulates for longer periods. When it finally releases, the resulting earthquake is much more powerful. This explains why the San Andreas Fault can be quiet for decades, then produce a massive quake.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does more friction cause bigger earthquakes?
  A: Friction locks plates together like pressing two erasers hard against each other. The more friction, the longer plates stay locked while stress builds. When the friction finally fails, ALL that stored energy releases at once — like letting go of a stretched rubber band. Less friction means frequent small releases; more friction means rare but devastating ones.
• Q: How can slow movement cause violent events?
  A: Even though plates move just centimeters per year, they are ENORMOUS — thousands of kilometers across and hundreds of kilometers thick. When something that massive moves and gets stuck, incredible amounts of energy accumulate. A few centimeters of movement across a plate that weighs billions of tons stores a phenomenal amount of energy.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design an Earthquake-Ready City
Mission: Design a city near a plate boundary that can withstand earthquakes using evidence from your tectonic model about earthquake intensity and frequency.
Scenario: A new city is being planned near the San Andreas Fault in California. The city council needs your engineering team to recommend building designs, infrastructure, and emergency systems based on what your model reveals about earthquake patterns.
Introduction: Present the scenario: A new city is being planned 50 miles from the San Andreas Fault. The city council needs engineering recommendations based on your tectonic model data.

Key Concepts:
• Seismic Engineering: Building designs that absorb or deflect earthquake energy, such as base isolation systems and flexible frames that sway without breaking.
• Earthquake Recurrence Interval: The average time between major earthquakes on a given fault. This helps predict future hazards and design for the right intensity.
• Liquefaction: During earthquakes, loose wet soil can behave like a liquid, causing buildings to sink. Foundation design must account for soil conditions.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): City design uses model evidence for earthquake predictions, includes multiple engineering solutions, and addresses emergency response
• Proficient (3): City design references model data and includes at least two engineering solutions
• Developing (2): City design mentions earthquakes but doesn't connect engineering solutions to model evidence
• Beginning (1): City design is incomplete or doesn't connect to plate tectonics concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a pre-labeled diagram of Earth's layers with convection current arrows drawn in
  • Use a physical demonstration: slide two textbooks past each other to show friction and sudden release
  • Sentence frames: 'When mantle heat increases, plate movement __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the 2011 Japan earthquake and explain it using plate tectonics theory
  • Model a divergent boundary (mid-ocean ridge) vs. a convergent boundary — how do they differ?
  • Calculate how far a plate moving at 5 cm/year would travel in 1 million years

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Plot earthquake data on a coordinate grid to identify plate boundary locations statistically
  • ELA: Write a news report about a fictional earthquake, explaining the science behind it to the public
  • Social Studies: Research how ancient civilizations explained earthquakes and volcanoes before plate tectonics theory

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how convection currents in Earth's mantle drive tectonic plate movement
• Use evidence to describe patterns of earthquake and volcano locations worldwide
• Model how interactions at plate boundaries produce geological events

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Scientists observe that earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault occur in clusters every 100-150 years. Which best explains this pattern using plate tectonic theory?
• Constructed Response: Using your model of plate tectonics, explain why the west coast of South America has many volcanoes and earthquakes while the east coast does not.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design an Earthquake-Ready City
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a city near a plate boundary that can withstand earthquakes using evidence from your tectonic model about earthquake intensity and frequency.

SCENARIO: A new city is being planned near the San Andreas Fault in California. The city council needs your engineering team to recommend building designs, infrastructure, and emergency systems based on what your model reveals about earthquake patterns.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Based on your model, how strong could earthquakes get at this boundary?
• What building designs would best survive the type of shaking your model predicts?
• How should emergency response systems be designed based on earthquake frequency patterns?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What building materials and foundations will resist earthquake shaking?

  _________________________________________________________

• Where should emergency shelters and hospitals be located relative to the fault?

  _________________________________________________________

• What early warning systems will you include in your city design?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will your city's infrastructure (roads, bridges, water pipes) handle ground movement?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): City design uses model evidence for earthquake predictions, includes multiple engineering solutions, and addresses emergency response
• Proficient (3): City design references model data and includes at least two engineering solutions
• Developing (2): City design mentions earthquakes but doesn't connect engineering solutions to model evidence
• Beginning (1): City design is incomplete or doesn't connect to plate tectonics concepts
