### Title
**Slime Is Serious Science — How Molecules Determine the Properties of Everything You Touch**

### Overview
The study of how molecular structure determines material properties is at the heart of chemistry and materials science. Slime is the perfect entry point because it demonstrates that 'solid' and 'liquid' aren't always clear-cut categories. Students investigate the driving question: Why does slime act like both a liquid AND a solid at the same time? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

SLIME IS SERIOUS SCIENCE

How Molecules Determine the Properties of Everything You Touch.
Why does slime act like both a liquid AND a solid at the same time?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Temperature" — the thermal energy affecting how fast molecules vibrate and move
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Molecule Size" — the length and mass of the polymer chains that make up the substance
  ○ Click "Bond Strength" — how strongly the molecules are connected to each other through chemical bonds
  ○ Click "Concentration" — the ratio of polymer molecules to solvent (water) in the mixture

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why does slime act like both a liquid AND a solid at the same time?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Molecule Size' — that's internal. The length and mass of the polymer chains that make up the substance.
Click on 'Bond Strength' — that's internal. How strongly the molecules are connected to each other through chemical bonds.
Click on 'Temperature' — that's external. The thermal energy affecting how fast molecules vibrate and move.
Click on 'Concentration' — that's internal. The ratio of polymer molecules to solvent (water) in the mixture.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Temperature is external because it comes from the environment and affects the substance from outside. Molecule Size, Bond Strength, and Concentration are internal because they are properties of the substance itself that can be engineered during creation.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Molecule Size" and drag an arrow to "Viscosity"
• Click on "Bond Strength" and drag an arrow to "Viscosity"
• Click on "Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Viscosity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Molecule Size → Viscosity = POSITIVE (+)
    Larger, longer polymer chains get tangled together more easily, making the substance thicker and more resistant to flow.

  ○ Bond Strength → Viscosity = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger bonds between molecules hold them together more tightly, resisting flow and making the substance behave more like a solid.

  ○ Temperature → Viscosity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher temperature gives molecules more kinetic energy, causing them to vibrate and move faster. This loosens bonds and reduces tangling, making the substance flow more easily.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When you increase concentration (add more glue to the slime), what happens to the viscosity? What about when you increase temperature?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Molecule Size' and drag an arrow
over to 'Viscosity.'

Here's the key question: When molecule size goes UP, does
viscosity go UP or DOWN?

Larger, longer polymer chains get tangled together more easily, making the substance thicker and more resistant to flow.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Bond Strength' and drag an arrow
over to 'Viscosity.'

Here's the key question: When bond strength goes UP, does
viscosity go UP or DOWN?

Stronger bonds between molecules hold them together more tightly, resisting flow and making the substance behave more like a solid.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Viscosity.'

Here's the key question: When temperature goes UP, does
viscosity go UP or DOWN?

Higher temperature gives molecules more kinetic energy, causing them to vibrate and move faster. This loosens bonds and reduces tangling, making the substance flow more easily.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When you increase concentration (add more glue to the slime), what happens to the viscosity? What about when you increase temperature?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Temperature is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — LIQUID SLIME
• Low concentration, weak bonds
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict the slime will act like — more liquid or more solid?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — PERFECT SLIME
• Moderate concentration and bond strength
• PREDICT FIRST: Why do you think 'perfect' slime can be both liquid and solid?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — SOLID SLIME
• Maximum concentration and bond strength
• PREDICT FIRST: At what point does slime stop behaving like a fluid entirely?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Longer polymer chains get tangled together, making the substance thicker and more viscous
• Stronger bonds between molecules mean the substance resists flowing — it acts more solid
• Temperature increases molecular movement, loosening bonds and making substances flow more easily
• Slime is non-Newtonian because its polymer chains tangle when squeezed but slide apart when relaxed

THE ANSWER: Slime acts like both a liquid and solid because it's made of long polymer chains that can slide past each other slowly (liquid behavior) but tangle and lock up when force is applied quickly (solid behavior). The molecule size, bond strength, and concentration determine exactly where the substance falls on the liquid-to-solid spectrum!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Liquid Slime. Low concentration, weak bonds.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Perfect Slime.
Moderate concentration and bond strength.

Before you run it — make a prediction. Why do you think 'perfect' slime can be both liquid and solid?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Solid Slime. Maximum concentration and bond strength.
At what point does slime stop behaving like a fluid entirely?

Here's what our model reveals: Slime acts like both a liquid and solid because it's made of long polymer chains that can slide past each other slowly (liquid behavior) but tangle and lock up when force is applied quickly (solid behavior). The molecule size, bond strength, and concentration determine exactly where the substance falls on the liquid-to-solid spectrum!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Temperature?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Cross-Linking Density — The number of chemical bridges between polymer chains — more cross-links make the substance stiffer
   • Solvent Type — Water vs. other liquids — different solvents interact differently with polymer chains
   • Additive Particles — Small particles added to the mixture can change its texture, color, and flow properties

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Polymers Everywhere — how does this connect to your model?
   • Non-Newtonian Fluids — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does slime stretch slowly but break when you pull it quickly?
   • How is making slime a chemical change, not just a physical change?
   • If you could design a molecule for the perfect bouncy ball, what would it look like?
   • Why does warming up slime make it runnier? What's happening to the molecules?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Cross-Linking Density. The number of chemical bridges between polymer chains — more cross-links make the substance stiffer
How would you model that?

Solvent Type. Water vs. other liquids — different solvents interact differently with polymer chains
How would you model that?

Additive Particles. Small particles added to the mixture can change its texture, color, and flow properties
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Slime Is Serious Science
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The study of how molecular structure determines material properties is at the heart of chemistry and materials science. Slime is the perfect entry point because it demonstrates that 'solid' and 'liquid' aren't always clear-cut categories.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS1-1, MS-PS1-2: Develop models to describe the atomic composition of simple molecules and extended structures. Analyze and interpret data on the properties of substances before and after the substances interact to determine if a chemical reaction has occurred.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how molecular size, bond strength, temperature, and concentration determine the physical properties of a substance.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS1.A Structure and Properties of Matter
  Substances are made from different types of atoms, which combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form molecules that range in size from simple to complex.
• Crosscutting Concept: Structure and Function
  Students discover that the STRUCTURE of molecules (their size, arrangement, and bonds) directly determines the FUNCTION (physical properties) of the substance.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Molecule, Polymer, Viscosity, Non-Newtonian Fluid
□ Prepare Why does slime act like both a liquid AND a solid at the same time discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify molecule size, bond strength, temperature, and concentration as the key components determining material properties.
• Establish: Students determine that larger molecules and stronger bonds increase viscosity (positive), while higher temperature decreases viscosity (negative).
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how molecular-level interactions produce observable material properties like viscosity and elasticity.
• Evaluate: Students run liquid vs. perfect vs. solid slime scenarios to observe how changing molecular variables affects physical behavior.
• Revise: Students add cross-linking density or solvent type to explore more complex material behaviors.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Polymers Everywhere:
  Polymers are long chain molecules made of repeating units (monomers). Natural polymers include DNA, proteins, cellulose (wood), and silk. Synthetic polymers include plastics, nylon, rubber, and silicone. The properties of a polymer depend on chain length, branching, and how chains interact with each other.

• Non-Newtonian Fluids:
  Most fluids (water, oil) have constant viscosity regardless of applied force. Non-Newtonian fluids change viscosity under stress. Slime is 'shear-thickening' — it gets MORE viscous under force. Ketchup is 'shear-thinning' — it gets LESS viscous under force (that's why you shake the bottle). These behaviors are determined by molecular structure.

• Chemical vs. Physical Changes:
  Making slime is a CHEMICAL change — the borax creates chemical cross-links between PVA (glue) polymer chains, forming a new substance with different properties. This is different from a physical change (like melting ice) where the molecular structure stays the same but the arrangement changes.

• Real-World Applications:
  Understanding polymer chemistry enables engineers to design bulletproof vests (Kevlar — aligned polymer chains), memory foam (temperature-responsive polymers), biodegradable plastics (polymers that bacteria can break down), and self-healing materials (polymers that can reconnect broken bonds).

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Matter is always clearly solid, liquid, or gas"
  Reality: Many real materials don't fit neatly into the three states. Non-Newtonian fluids, gels, plasmas, and amorphous solids (glass) blur the boundaries. The states of matter are useful categories but nature is more complex.
  Strategy: Demo: Show slime behaving as solid AND liquid. Ask: Which state is it? The answer: it depends on how you interact with it.

• "Molecules don't move in solids"
  Reality: Molecules are ALWAYS moving — in all states of matter. In solids, they vibrate in place. In liquids, they slide past each other. In gases, they fly freely. Temperature determines how much they move. Even at absolute zero, there is still some quantum vibration.
  Strategy: Connect to temperature: Warming slime makes molecules move MORE, which is why it gets runnier.

• "Chemical changes can be easily reversed"
  Reality: Chemical changes create new substances with new properties. Making slime creates chemical cross-links that can't be undone by stirring or cooling. This is different from physical changes (like ice melting) which are easily reversed. The key test: is a new substance formed?
  Strategy: Compare: Can you un-bake a cake? Can you un-make slime? These are chemical changes. Can you re-freeze water? That's a physical change — easily reversed.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why does slime act like both a liquid AND a solid at the same time?
Answer: Slime acts like both a liquid and solid because it's made of long polymer chains that can slide past each other slowly (liquid behavior) but tangle and lock up when force is applied quickly (solid behavior). The molecule size, bond strength, and concentration determine exactly where the substance falls on the liquid-to-solid spectrum!

Simulation Answers:
• Liquid vs. Perfect Slime: At 20% concentration with weak bonds, the substance flows freely like a liquid — polymer chains are sparse and barely interact. At 60% concentration with moderate bonds, the substance shows non-Newtonian behavior — it flows slowly but resists sudden force. The model shows how concentration and bond strength create the sweet spot.
• Temperature Effect: When temperature increases on perfect slime, viscosity drops noticeably. The polymer chains gain kinetic energy and slide past each other more easily. This is why warm slime is runnier than cold slime — and why warming honey makes it flow faster.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does slime stretch slowly but break when pulled fast?
  A: When pulled slowly, the polymer chains have time to untangle and slide past each other, allowing the slime to stretch. When pulled fast, the chains can't rearrange quickly enough — they lock up and snap rather than slide. It's like slowly pulling tangled headphones apart vs. yanking them — slow works, fast breaks.
• Q: How is making slime a chemical change?
  A: When borax is added to glue, it creates chemical cross-links between the PVA polymer chains. These are new chemical bonds that didn't exist before — creating an entirely new substance with different properties. The cross-links are what make slime stretchy instead of just liquid glue. You can't reverse the process by just stirring — that's the signature of a chemical change.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design the Perfect Slime Formula
Mission: Engineer a slime with specific target properties (stretch distance, bounce height, flow rate) by adjusting your molecular recipe based on model evidence.
Scenario: A toy company needs a new slime product. They want three versions: 'Super Stretch' (maximum elongation), 'Bouncy Blob' (maximum bounce), and 'Slow Flow' (slowest pour). Your chemistry team must design formulas for all three using your molecular model.
Introduction: Present the toy company scenario: They need three slime products with specific measurable properties. Your team must design formulas using evidence from the molecular model.

Key Concepts:
• Cross-Linking: Chemical bridges between polymer chains that determine flexibility. Few cross-links = stretchy. Many cross-links = stiff. This is how rubber bands and bowling balls can both be made from polymers.
• Viscoelasticity: Materials that show both viscous (liquid) and elastic (solid) behavior. Slime is viscoelastic — it flows like a liquid over time but bounces like a solid when hit quickly.
• Thixotropy: Some non-Newtonian fluids become more liquid when stirred and more solid when still. Ketchup is thixotropic — that's why shaking the bottle helps it flow.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Three distinct formulas with measurable targets, uses model evidence to justify ratios, includes test data and comparisons
• Proficient (3): At least two formulas with model evidence, includes testing plan and measurements
• Developing (2): Formulas created but not clearly connected to molecular model evidence
• Beginning (1): Single formula without clear connection to molecular structure concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide molecular model kits or drawings showing short vs. long polymer chains to visualize size differences
  • Use spaghetti noodles of different lengths as a physical analogy for polymer chains tangling
  • Sentence frames: 'When bond strength increases, the substance becomes more __ because the molecules __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how Kevlar's molecular structure makes it strong enough to stop bullets
  • Investigate shape-memory polymers that can return to a preset shape when heated
  • Design an experiment comparing the viscosity of different household fluids and explaining the molecular reasons

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph the relationship between concentration and viscosity — is it linear, exponential, or something else?
  • ELA: Write a scientific procedure for making slime that someone else could follow to get the exact same results
  • Art: Design product packaging for your three slime formulas, including scientific explanations for consumers

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Describe how the arrangement of molecules determines a substance's properties
• Distinguish between physical and chemical changes based on molecular-level evidence
• Model how changing molecular structure changes material behavior

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Two liquids look identical but one is water (viscosity: 1 cP) and one is glycerol (viscosity: 1500 cP). What molecular difference best explains why glycerol is much thicker?
• Constructed Response: Explain why slime can act like a solid when you hit it quickly but flows like a liquid when you let it sit. Use the concepts of polymer chains and molecular interaction in your answer.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design the Perfect Slime Formula
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Engineer a slime with specific target properties (stretch distance, bounce height, flow rate) by adjusting your molecular recipe based on model evidence.

SCENARIO: A toy company needs a new slime product. They want three versions: 'Super Stretch' (maximum elongation), 'Bouncy Blob' (maximum bounce), and 'Slow Flow' (slowest pour). Your chemistry team must design formulas for all three using your molecular model.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How does changing polymer chain length affect stretchiness vs. bounciness?
• What concentration and bond strength produces the slowest flow rate?
• How will you test and measure each property to prove your formula works?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What ratio of glue to activator will you use for each slime type?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure stretch distance, bounce height, and flow rate consistently?

  _________________________________________________________

• What happens if you change the temperature of your slime? Does it help or hurt?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you record and compare your results for the three formulas?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Three distinct formulas with measurable targets, uses model evidence to justify ratios, includes test data and comparisons
• Proficient (3): At least two formulas with model evidence, includes testing plan and measurements
• Developing (2): Formulas created but not clearly connected to molecular model evidence
• Beginning (1): Single formula without clear connection to molecular structure concepts
