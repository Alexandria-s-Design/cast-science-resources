### Title
**Whose Air Is This? — Why Kids Near Freeways Have Higher Asthma Rates (and It's Not a Coincidence)**

### Overview
Students model the relationship between vehicle traffic, wind patterns, air pollution concentration, and respiratory health — discovering that where you live can determine the quality of the air you breathe, and that this disparity is not random. By building a cause-and-effect model that shows how traffic increases pollution and wind disperses it, students connect environmental science to environmental justice, discovering that communities near freeways and industrial areas face measurable health disadvantages. This lesson empowers students to understand air quality science while building advocacy awareness.

### Cover Image

The connection between the two is made visible through a hazy overlay. The tone is serious but not hopeless — these students have knowledge and agency.]

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-ESS3-1**: Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how vehicle traffic and wind patterns interact to determine air pollution levels
- Explain why communities near freeways experience higher rates of respiratory illness
- Predict how changes in traffic density or wind patterns affect community health outcomes
- Identify scientific and community-based approaches to improving air quality

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Vehicle Traffic Density | External | The volume of cars and trucks in the area — determined by road infrastructure students can't control |
| Wind Speed | External | How fast air is moving — natural weather pattern |
| Air Pollution Concentration | Internal | The buildup of exhaust, particulates, and gases in the local air |
| Respiratory Health Impact | Internal | The measurable health effects on the community — asthma rates, hospitalizations |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Air Quality System

### Text Editor

```
WHOSE AIR IS THIS?

Here's a data point that shouldn't exist:

Children who live within 500 meters of a freeway have higher rates
of asthma, lower lung function, and more emergency room visits for
breathing problems than children who live farther away.

This is not a coincidence. This is not bad luck.

This is a system — and once you understand the system, you understand
why this keeps happening and what would need to change to stop it.

The system involves traffic, wind, and the air those children breathe
every day. Let's model it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things the community can't easily control):
  ○ Click "Vehicle Traffic Density" — road infrastructure determines this
  ○ Click "Wind Speed" — weather determines this
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Air Pollution Concentration" — builds up or disperses based on other factors
  ○ Click "Respiratory Health Impact" — this is what affects real people's bodies

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Which come from outside the community's direct control?
• Which change as a result of those external factors?
• Sort them, then your teacher will explain the connections

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Children living near freeways breathe dirtier air than children
living miles away. Your model is about to explain exactly why.
```

### Video Script

```
"I want to show you something about where you live.

If you drew a 500-meter circle around a freeway — about 5 city blocks —
the children inside that circle are more likely to develop asthma.
More likely to have lower lung function. More likely to end up in the
emergency room with breathing problems.

This isn't random. This isn't their bodies being different. This is
where they live. The air they breathe. Every day. From birth.

Here's what makes this a science problem AND a justice problem: it's
not distributed equally. Historically, freeways were built through
communities that had less political power to stop them. Low-income
communities and communities of color are disproportionately located
near freeways and industrial facilities.

The air quality problem is real. The distribution of that problem
is not neutral.

Today you're going to build the model that explains how this works.
Because understanding the system is the first step to changing it.

Look at your component panel.

Vehicle Traffic Density — external. The number and type of vehicles
on nearby roads. Communities don't easily control how many cars or
trucks use a freeway next to their homes.

Wind Speed — also external. Weather determines wind. Wind is actually
a natural defense — it disperses pollution. But still communities
can't control the wind.

Air Pollution Concentration — internal. This changes based on how
much traffic is producing pollution and how much wind is dispersing it.

Respiratory Health Impact — internal. This is the human cost. Asthma
rates, lung function, hospitalizations. This responds to air quality.

Sort your components. Add them to your canvas.

Whose air is this? Let's find out.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Air Quality System

### Text Editor

```
MAPPING THE AIR QUALITY CHAIN

Traffic produces pollution. Wind spreads it out. When there's not
enough wind, pollution builds up. When it builds up, people get sick.
Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Vehicle Traffic Density → Air Pollution Concentration
• Wind Speed → Air Pollution Concentration
• Air Pollution Concentration → Respiratory Health Impact

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
  ○ Vehicle Traffic → Air Pollution = POSITIVE (+)
    More vehicles = MORE exhaust, particulates, and gases in the air
    (Each car/truck adds CO, NOx, particulate matter to the air)

  ○ Wind Speed → Air Pollution = NEGATIVE (−)
    More wind = LESS pollution concentration
    (Wind disperses and dilutes the pollution, moving it away)

  ○ Air Pollution → Respiratory Health Impact = POSITIVE (+)
    More pollution = MORE health impact (more asthma triggers, lung damage)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows: 2 positive, 1 negative
• The negative relationship is CRITICAL — wind is the community's natural defense

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Notice: Wind FIGHTS pollution. Traffic ADDS to it. Respiratory
health depends on which force wins.
```

### Video Script

```
"Let's map the air quality chain. Click the Connect icon.

First connection: Vehicle Traffic Density to Air Pollution Concentration.

Every car and truck burns fuel. That combustion releases carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and tiny particles called particulate matter —
PM2.5, so small they can enter your bloodstream through your lungs.
More traffic = more of all these pollutants entering the air.

More traffic = more pollution. POSITIVE. Click the plus sign.

Second connection: Wind Speed to Air Pollution Concentration.

Here's where it gets interesting. Wind doesn't create pollution —
but it disperses it. A steady breeze moves pollution away from
its source, spreads it across a wider area, and dilutes it to
lower concentrations.

No wind? Pollution stays near the freeway, building up. Strong wind?
Pollution gets diluted and spread.

More wind = LESS concentrated pollution. NEGATIVE. Click the minus sign.

Third: Air Pollution Concentration to Respiratory Health Impact.

Particulate matter gets inside lungs. NOx creates ozone that damages
airway tissue. Carbon monoxide enters the bloodstream. The more
concentrated the pollution, the more exposure, the more health damage.

More pollution = more impact. POSITIVE.

Look at your model. Traffic adds. Wind removes. The balance between
them determines what the children near that freeway breathe.

On a still summer day with heavy traffic? Pollution builds up.
On a windy day with moderate traffic? It disperses.

Neither community chose to be near a freeway. But the science
explains exactly why their air quality varies day to day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Air Quality Model

### Text Editor

```
SIMULATE WHAT COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE

Your model shows the air quality system. Now let's run real-world
scenarios and see what communities living near freeways face.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click "Play" in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines

STEP 2: BASELINE CONDITIONS
• Let it run for about 30 time steps at normal traffic and wind
• Where does Respiratory Health Impact stabilize?

STEP 3: MORNING RUSH HOUR (High Traffic, Low Wind)
• Lock Traffic to HIGH (90%) — morning commute on a freeway
• Lock Wind Speed to LOW (10%) — calm summer morning (no breeze)
• Watch Pollution Concentration build up
• Watch Respiratory Health Impact rise

This scenario represents exactly what communities near freeways experience.

STEP 4: WINDY AFTERNOON (Same Traffic, High Wind)
• Keep Traffic HIGH (90%), increase Wind Speed to HIGH (80%)
• Watch Pollution Concentration respond
• Does Respiratory Health Impact improve?
• This is why air quality varies by day — same traffic, but wind changes everything

STEP 5: LOW TRAFFIC DAY (Holiday, Weekend)
• Keep moderate wind. Drop Traffic to LOW (20%)
• Watch what happens to air quality
• This is measurable in real cities — air quality improves significantly on holidays

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• Why do communities near freeways have worse air quality even when the wind blows?
• What would need to change in the system to protect children's health?
• Why is this a SCIENCE problem AND a JUSTICE problem?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your air quality model is ready. Let's run the scenarios that
communities near freeways actually experience.

Click Play. Baseline conditions. Normal traffic, moderate wind.
Watch where things settle. Some pollution, some health impact.
This is the 'normal' that many neighborhoods live with every day.

Now: morning rush hour. Lock Traffic to 90%. Lock Wind to 10%.
Calm summer morning. Millions of commuters on the freeway.

Watch Pollution Concentration climb. No wind to disperse it —
it builds up near the freeway, near the houses, near the schools.

Watch Respiratory Health Impact rise. This is the morning asthma
trigger for kids living in those neighborhoods. This is the spike
in inhaler use. This is why pediatric asthma ER visits are higher
in certain zip codes than others.

Now keep the same traffic but raise Wind to 80%. Windy afternoon.

Watch Pollution Concentration drop — the wind is dispersing it.
Watch Respiratory Health Impact begin to improve.

Same freeway. Same cars. Same neighborhood. Just wind — a natural
weather event — determines whether it's a healthy breathing day.

Now try the holiday scenario. Drop Traffic to 20%. Scientists have
actually measured this: on Thanksgiving and Christmas, when traffic
drops significantly, air quality measurably improves in cities.
The science is that direct.

Here's what I want you to sit with: the children living near freeways
didn't choose to live there. Their families didn't choose bad air.

But the system — traffic plus the presence or absence of wind —
creates measurably different health outcomes based on location.

Understanding this system is how we change it.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
FROM UNDERSTANDING TO ACTION

Your model explains HOW air pollution builds up and affects health.
But communities are not helpless. People who understand this system
are using science to change it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. FIND THE THRESHOLD
   • At what Traffic level does Respiratory Health Impact become "serious"?
   • Is there a Wind Speed that can offset even the highest traffic?
   • Can wind alone protect a community from freeway pollution? (Answer: mostly no)

2. WHAT WOULD HELP?
   • What if we added "Electric Vehicles" — same traffic density, but zero exhaust?
   • What if we added "Trees and Vegetation Barriers"? Trees can capture particles.
   • What if traffic were reduced 50%? Model the health impact.

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Real air quality involves even more factors:

   • Temperature/Inversions — warm air trapping cold polluted air close to ground
   • Industrial Sources — factories, power plants near neighborhoods
   • Indoor vs Outdoor — kids spend time inside; indoor air quality matters too
   • Cumulative Exposure — health effects build over years, not just bad days
   • Community Monitoring — residents using sensors to track their own air quality

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What are the major air pollutants and their sources?
   • How does the Clean Air Act protect communities?
   • What are the health effects of particulate matter?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • What is an "air quality index" and how is it measured?
   • Which cities have the worst air quality in the United States? Why?
   • What is an environmental justice community? What is environmental racism?
   • What are communities near freeways doing to advocate for cleaner air?

🌐 RELIABLE SOURCES:
   • American Lung Association: lung.org
   • EPA Air Now: airnow.gov
   • Environmental Defense Fund: edf.org

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Add "Green Infrastructure / Trees" as an Internal component
   • Trees capture particulate matter — so more trees = LESS pollution concentration
   • That's a NEGATIVE relationship to Air Pollution
   • Run it. Does adding trees to your model improve Respiratory Health Impact?
   • This models a real solution communities are implementing right now
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model explains the air quality problem. Now let's talk about
what people are doing to change it — and how your model can show
those solutions working.

Communities near freeways aren't just suffering. They're organizing.

In Los Angeles, residents near the 710 freeway have been monitoring
their own air quality with low-cost sensors, gathering data to present
to city officials. They're not waiting for scientists to tell them
what they already know from living there. They're becoming the scientists.

In New York, advocates pushed for electric school buses — same number
of buses, same routes, but zero tailpipe exhaust near the schools.
Same traffic density in your model. But if vehicles emit nothing?
Watch what happens to Air Pollution Concentration.

In Oakland, community groups planted thousands of trees along freeways
as living barriers. Trees are excellent particulate matter filters —
their leaves capture tiny particles from the air before they reach homes.

Here's your extension: add 'Green Infrastructure' to your model.

It's an internal component — it changes based on what the community
does. And it has a NEGATIVE effect on Air Pollution Concentration —
more trees, fewer particles reaching homes.

Connect it. Run it. Does adding trees improve Respiratory Health Impact?

Now try the electric vehicle scenario — same traffic, but drop the
pollution contribution of each vehicle. How does reducing exhaust
per vehicle change outcomes?

Your model can now show SOLUTIONS, not just the problem.

And here's something to think about: which solution is more within
a community's control — getting a freeway removed, convincing
millions of drivers to use electric cars, or planting trees?

Communities are already choosing. Your model shows why it matters.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💨 CAREER CONNECTION: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENTIST / AIR QUALITY MONITOR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Environmental Health Scientists study how the environment affects
human health — including air quality, water contamination, and exposure
to toxic substances. They collect data, build models (just like the one
you made today), and work with communities and policymakers to identify
health risks and push for protective regulations.

Air Quality Monitors work for government agencies, environmental
organizations, and increasingly, communities themselves — deploying
sensor networks to track pollution in real time. During wildfires,
heatwaves, and high-traffic periods, their data helps communities
make decisions about going outside, keeping windows closed, and
warning people with asthma.

💰 SALARY: $60,000 - $95,000 per year

These scientists often work directly in and with the communities they
study — combining technical expertise with advocacy. They use models
exactly like the one you built today to understand, communicate, and
ultimately change the conditions that affect community health.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: Whose Air Is This?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson connects air quality science directly to environmental
justice — making the 5-ESS3-1 standard personally and socially
relevant. The freeway/asthma phenomenon is real, documented, and
emotionally resonant for students who may live near or know people
affected by this issue. The lesson intentionally builds both
scientific understanding and civic awareness without being preachy.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-ESS3-1: Obtain and combine information about ways individual
communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources
and environment.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: check your local Air Quality Index at airnow.gov before class
□ Optional: Find your school's distance from the nearest freeway
□ Review vocabulary: air quality index, particulate matter, respiratory

SENSITIVITY NOTE:
Some students may have asthma or have family members affected by
air quality issues. Frame the lesson in a way that validates
experience without singling out individuals. The goal is to explain
the SYSTEM, not to make any student feel targeted or stigmatized.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Air pollution only matters in cities" → Rural areas near industrial sites
  and agriculture face pollution challenges too
• "This affects everyone equally" → Environmental justice research documents
  significant disparities in who bears the burden of air pollution
• "Individual behavior causes this" → Vehicle infrastructure is a systems-level
  issue, not primarily an individual choice problem

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Open with local air quality data if possible — airnow.gov shows
  current AQI for any location. This immediately grounds the lesson in the real.
• Activity 2: The negative Wind → Pollution relationship can be demonstrated by
  asking "What's the air like near a campfire on a still night vs. a windy night?"
• Activity 3: The holiday traffic scenario is compelling — students are often
  surprised that air quality measurably improves on low-traffic days.
• Activity 4: Focus on community agency — the solutions section is empowering.
  Communities are not just suffering; they're responding with science.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "Do you think it's fair that your health is affected by where you live?
  Whose responsibility is it to fix that?"
• "What would you do if you lived near a freeway and your family had asthma?"
• "Why might electric vehicles help but not completely solve the problem?"
• "What does it mean to use science to advocate for your community?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Weather and atmosphere → How temperature inversions trap pollution
• Government and civics → Clean Air Act history and environmental regulation
• Community action → How residents use air quality data to advocate for change

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student explain the negative relationship between wind and pollution?
• Does student correctly identify that traffic adds and wind removes pollution?
• Did student connect the model to at least one real community solution?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide sentence starters for explaining environmental justice connection
Challenge: Research local air quality data; graph it against demographic data
ELL: Use AQI color coding as visual anchor; the traffic/wind analogy is universally accessible
