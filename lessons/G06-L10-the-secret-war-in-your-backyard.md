### Title
**The Secret War in Your Backyard — How Ecosystems Balance Competition, Cooperation, and Survival**

### Overview
Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Every ecosystem — from your backyard to the Amazon — operates on the same fundamental principles of competition, predation, cooperation, and energy flow. Students investigate the driving question: Even a tiny backyard is a hidden battlefield — how do organisms compete, cooperate, and survive in a complex ecosystem? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE SECRET WAR IN YOUR BACKYARD

How Ecosystems Balance Competition, Cooperation, and Survival.
Even a tiny backyard is a hidden battlefield — how do organisms compete, cooperate, and survive in a complex ecosystem?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Habitat Size" — the total area of suitable living space available to organisms in the ecosystem
  ○ Click "Resource Availability" — the amount of food
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Predator Population" — the number of organisms that hunt and eat other organisms in the ecosystem
  ○ Click "Prey Population" — the number of organisms that are hunted by predators — typically herbivores eating plants

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Even a tiny backyard is a hidden battlefield — how do organisms compete, cooperate, and survive in a complex ecosystem?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Predator Population' — that's internal. The number of organisms that hunt and eat other organisms in the ecosystem.
Click on 'Prey Population' — that's internal. The number of organisms that are hunted by predators — typically herbivores eating plants.
Click on 'Habitat Size' — that's external. The total area of suitable living space available to organisms in the ecosystem.
Click on 'Resource Availability' — that's external. The amount of food.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Habitat Size and Resource Availability are external because they represent environmental conditions that exist independent of the organisms — they set the stage for the ecosystem. Predator Population and Prey Population are internal because they are the living components of the ecosystem that change dynamically in response to each other and to environmental conditions.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Prey Population" and drag an arrow to "Predator Population"
• Click on "Predator Population" and drag an arrow to "Prey Population"
• Click on "Habitat Size" and drag an arrow to "Carrying Capacity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Prey Population → Predator Population = POSITIVE (+)
    More prey means more food available for predators, allowing predator populations to grow. When prey is abundant, predators reproduce more and survive longer.

  ○ Predator Population → Prey Population = NEGATIVE (−)
    More predators consume more prey, reducing the prey population. This creates the classic predator-prey cycle where both populations oscillate.

  ○ Habitat Size → Carrying Capacity = POSITIVE (+)
    Larger habitat provides more resources, shelter, and territory, increasing the maximum population the environment can support for both predators and prey.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When prey population increases, what happens to predator population? And when predator population increases, what happens to prey? Do these relationships create a cycle?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Prey Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Predator Population.'

Here's the key question: When prey population goes UP, does
predator population go UP or DOWN?

More prey means more food available for predators, allowing predator populations to grow. When prey is abundant, predators reproduce more and survive longer.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Predator Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Prey Population.'

Here's the key question: When predator population goes UP, does
prey population go UP or DOWN?

More predators consume more prey, reducing the prey population. This creates the classic predator-prey cycle where both populations oscillate.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Habitat Size' and drag an arrow
over to 'Carrying Capacity.'

Here's the key question: When habitat size goes UP, does
carrying capacity go UP or DOWN?

Larger habitat provides more resources, shelter, and territory, increasing the maximum population the environment can support for both predators and prey.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When prey population increases, what happens to predator population? And when predator population increases, what happens to prey? Do these relationships create a cycle?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Habitat Size is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — BALANCED ECOSYSTEM
• Moderate predators, prey, habitat, and resources
• PREDICT FIRST: What pattern do you predict predator and prey populations will follow over time?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — PREDATOR REMOVAL
• Predator Population locked at zero
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to prey population when predators are removed?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — HABITAT LOSS
• Habitat Size reduced to 25%
• PREDICT FIRST: How does shrinking habitat affect BOTH predator and prey populations?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Predator and prey populations naturally cycle — when prey increases, predators follow, then prey crashes, then predators crash
• Removing predators causes prey to overshoot carrying capacity, depleting resources and causing a population crash
• Habitat loss reduces carrying capacity for ALL species, often pushing the smallest populations to extinction first
• Biodiversity makes ecosystems more resilient — diverse ecosystems recover from disturbances faster than simple ones

THE ANSWER: Your backyard is a battlefield of constant competition and cooperation. Predators control prey populations, prey control plant populations, and decomposers recycle everything. These interactions create a dynamic balance. When humans disrupt that balance — by removing predators, shrinking habitat, or introducing invasive species — the entire ecosystem can collapse like a chain of dominoes.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Balanced Ecosystem. Moderate predators, prey, habitat, and resources.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Predator Removal.
Predator Population locked at zero.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to prey population when predators are removed?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Habitat Loss. Habitat Size reduced to 25%.
How does shrinking habitat affect BOTH predator and prey populations?

Here's what our model reveals: Your backyard is a battlefield of constant competition and cooperation. Predators control prey populations, prey control plant populations, and decomposers recycle everything. These interactions create a dynamic balance. When humans disrupt that balance — by removing predators, shrinking habitat, or introducing invasive species — the entire ecosystem can collapse like a chain of dominoes.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Habitat Size?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Resource Availability?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Invasive Species — Non-native organisms that outcompete local species for resources, often with no natural predators
   • Decomposer Activity — The rate at which dead organisms are broken down and nutrients recycled back into the soil
   • Climate Conditions — Temperature and rainfall patterns that determine which organisms can survive in an area

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Predator-Prey Dynamics — how does this connect to your model?
   • Trophic Cascades — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why do predator and prey populations rise and fall in cycles instead of staying constant?
   • What happened when wolves were removed from Yellowstone — and what happened when they were brought back?
   • Why does losing biodiversity make an ecosystem more vulnerable to collapse?
   • Is it possible for an ecosystem to survive without decomposers? Why or why not?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Invasive Species. Non-native organisms that outcompete local species for resources, often with no natural predators
How would you model that?

Decomposer Activity. The rate at which dead organisms are broken down and nutrients recycled back into the soil
How would you model that?

Climate Conditions. Temperature and rainfall patterns that determine which organisms can survive in an area
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Secret War in Your Backyard
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Ecology is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. Every ecosystem — from your backyard to the Amazon — operates on the same fundamental principles of competition, predation, cooperation, and energy flow.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS2-2, MS-LS2-3, MS-LS2-5: Construct an explanation that predicts patterns of interactions among organisms across multiple ecosystems. Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy among living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem. Evaluate competing design solutions for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how predator and prey populations interact with habitat size and resource availability to create ecosystem dynamics.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS2.A Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems / LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
  Organisms and populations of organisms are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other living things and with nonliving factors. Ecosystems are dynamic and can respond to disruptions.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students explore how ecosystems maintain dynamic stability through population cycles, and how disruptions (habitat loss, species removal) can push systems past tipping points into instability.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Ecosystem, Biodiversity, Carrying Capacity, Trophic Level
□ Prepare Even a tiny backyard is a hidden battlefield — how do organisms compete, cooperate, and survive in a complex ecosystem discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify predator population, prey population, habitat size, and resource availability as the key components driving ecosystem dynamics.
• Establish: Students discover the cyclical relationships: prey positively affects predators (more food), predators negatively affect prey (consumption), and both depend positively on habitat and resources.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how predator-prey cycles emerge from simple component interactions and how external changes disrupt these cycles.
• Evaluate: Students run balanced, predator-removal, and habitat-loss scenarios to observe how ecosystems respond to different types of disruption.
• Revise: Students add invasive species or decomposer activity to explore more complex ecosystem interactions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Predator-Prey Dynamics:
  Predator and prey populations naturally cycle in a predictable pattern: when prey is abundant, predators thrive and increase. More predators reduce prey numbers. Fewer prey causes predators to decline. Fewer predators allows prey to recover. This Lotka-Volterra cycle repeats indefinitely in a healthy ecosystem. The famous example is the lynx and snowshoe hare cycle in Canada, documented over 100+ years.

• Trophic Cascades:
  When a top predator is removed, the effects cascade through the entire food web. In Yellowstone, removing wolves caused elk to overgraze riverbanks, which caused erosion, which degraded streams, which reduced fish populations, which affected bears and eagles. When wolves were reintroduced in 1995, the entire ecosystem recovered — even the rivers changed course. This is called a trophic cascade.

• Carrying Capacity:
  Every environment has a maximum population it can support — its carrying capacity. This limit is determined by available food, water, space, and shelter. When a population exceeds carrying capacity, individuals compete for scarce resources, death rates increase, and the population crashes. Habitat loss reduces carrying capacity, making population crashes more likely.

• Biodiversity and Resilience:
  Ecosystems with more species are more resilient to disturbance. If one species is lost in a diverse ecosystem, others can fill its ecological role. In a simple ecosystem with few species, losing one can collapse the whole system. This is why biodiversity conservation is critical — it's not just about saving individual species, it's about maintaining ecosystem function for all life, including humans.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Predators are bad for ecosystems"
  Reality: Predators are ESSENTIAL for ecosystem health. They prevent prey from overshooting carrying capacity, keep ecosystems balanced, and maintain biodiversity. Removing top predators consistently leads to ecosystem degradation. The Yellowstone wolf story is the most famous demonstration of this principle.
  Strategy: Ask: If predators are bad, why did Yellowstone get WORSE without wolves and BETTER when wolves returned?

• "Ecosystems will balance themselves no matter what"
  Reality: While ecosystems are resilient to small disturbances, they have tipping points beyond which they cannot recover. If habitat loss, pollution, or species removal pushes an ecosystem past its tipping point, it can collapse to a fundamentally different state that may take centuries to recover — if it can recover at all.
  Strategy: Show examples of ecosystem collapse: deforested Amazon turning to grassland, coral reefs dying to algae fields. Some changes are not easily reversible.

• "Only large animals matter in ecosystems"
  Reality: Every species plays a role, and some of the most important are the smallest. Insects pollinate plants, decomposers recycle nutrients, bacteria fix nitrogen, and plankton produce half the world's oxygen. Losing a 'small' species can have cascading effects just as dramatic as losing a large predator.
  Strategy: Ask: What happens if all the bees disappear? 35% of food crops depend on bee pollination. Small organisms, massive impact.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Even a tiny backyard is a hidden battlefield — how do organisms compete, cooperate, and survive in a complex ecosystem?
Answer: Your backyard is a battlefield of constant competition and cooperation. Predators control prey populations, prey control plant populations, and decomposers recycle everything. These interactions create a dynamic balance. When humans disrupt that balance — by removing predators, shrinking habitat, or introducing invasive species — the entire ecosystem can collapse like a chain of dominoes.

Simulation Answers:
• Predator Removal Scenario: When predators are removed, prey populations initially skyrocket — but then crash dramatically. Without predators controlling their numbers, prey overshoot the carrying capacity, deplete their food resources, and suffer a massive population crash. The model shows that predators STABILIZE prey populations by preventing overshoot — removing them is actually bad for prey in the long run.
• Habitat Loss Scenario: At 25% habitat, carrying capacity drops for both species. Prey populations shrink to fit the smaller habitat, and predator populations shrink even more because there are fewer prey. If habitat shrinks enough, predator populations may drop below the minimum viable population and go extinct — triggering the same cascade as predator removal.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why do populations cycle instead of staying constant?
  A: Populations cycle because of TIME DELAYS in the system. When prey increases, predators don't increase instantly — it takes time to reproduce. During that delay, prey keeps growing. When predators finally catch up, they overshoot and eat too many prey. Then predators decline because food is scarce, giving prey time to recover. The cycle repeats because each population's response is always slightly delayed behind the other's.
• Q: What happened with Yellowstone wolves?
  A: When wolves were removed from Yellowstone in the 1920s, elk populations exploded. Without fear of wolves, elk overgrazed riverbanks, destroying willow and aspen trees. Without trees, riverbanks eroded, streams widened, water warmed, and fish declined. Beavers disappeared because they need willows. When wolves were reintroduced in 1995, elk moved away from rivers (fear effect). Trees regrew, beavers returned, streams narrowed, and the entire ecosystem recovered. Wolves literally changed the rivers.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Biodiversity Rescue Plan
Mission: Design an evidence-based plan to restore biodiversity in a degraded ecosystem, using your model to predict which interventions will be most effective.
Scenario: A local nature preserve has lost 60% of its habitat to development. Deer populations have exploded without wolves, overgrazing vegetation. Bird species are declining, and the stream ecosystem is degrading. Your ecology team must design a restoration plan using model evidence.
Introduction: Present the degraded nature preserve scenario: 60% habitat loss, no wolves, deer explosion, vegetation overgrazing, declining bird species, degrading streams. Your team must prioritize interventions using model evidence.

Key Concepts:
• Trophic Cascade: When changes at the top of a food web cascade down through every level. Removing a top predator doesn't just help prey — it can transform the entire ecosystem, even affecting rivers and landscapes.
• Minimum Viable Population: The smallest population size that can survive long-term. Below this number, inbreeding, random events, and inability to find mates lead to extinction. For large predators, this is typically 50-500 individuals.
• Wildlife Corridors: Strips of habitat connecting isolated nature preserves. These allow animals to move between areas, maintaining genetic diversity and allowing populations to respond to environmental changes.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan identifies key species, uses model evidence for all interventions, includes timeline and monitoring strategy, addresses multiple trophic levels
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses at least two interventions with model evidence and explains expected ecosystem effects
• Developing (2): Plan mentions conservation but doesn't justify interventions with ecosystem model evidence
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of ecosystem interactions

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simple food web diagram for the preserve showing connections between species
  • Use physical tokens (colored chips) to simulate predator-prey interactions on a tabletop 'habitat'
  • Sentence frames: 'When predator population increases, prey population __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction and create a timeline of ecosystem changes
  • Investigate how invasive species like zebra mussels or Asian carp disrupt ecosystem balance
  • Design a biodiversity survey protocol for your school grounds — how many species can you identify?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph predator-prey population data from the Lotka-Volterra model and calculate the cycle period
  • ELA: Write a persuasive letter to a senator arguing for increased funding for wildlife corridors, using ecosystem evidence
  • Social Studies: Research how indigenous communities managed ecosystems sustainably for thousands of years before European colonization

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Predict patterns of interaction among organisms in ecosystems
• Describe how matter and energy flow through ecosystems
• Evaluate design solutions for maintaining biodiversity

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: In a grassland ecosystem, a disease kills 80% of the rabbit population. Which of the following is the most likely short-term effect on other species in the ecosystem?
• Constructed Response: A state park manager is considering reintroducing wolves to control an overpopulated deer herd. Using ecosystem concepts, predict what would happen to the deer population, vegetation, and overall biodiversity if wolves were reintroduced.

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Ecosystem                     
___ Biodiversity                  
___ Carrying Capacity             
___ Trophic Level                 

A. A community of living organisms interacting with each other and their nonliving environment
B. The variety of different species in an ecosystem — more biodiversity generally means a healthier ecosystem
C. The maximum population size an environment can sustain given available food, water, and space
D. An organism's position in a food chain — producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, decomposers

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Biodiversity Rescue Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design an evidence-based plan to restore biodiversity in a degraded ecosystem, using your model to predict which interventions will be most effective.

SCENARIO: A local nature preserve has lost 60% of its habitat to development. Deer populations have exploded without wolves, overgrazing vegetation. Bird species are declining, and the stream ecosystem is degrading. Your ecology team must design a restoration plan using model evidence.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Based on your model, which single intervention would have the greatest positive impact on biodiversity?
• Should predators be reintroduced? What does your model predict will happen?
• How much habitat must be restored to support a balanced ecosystem?

DESIGN THINKING:
• Which species will you prioritize for protection or reintroduction?

  _________________________________________________________

• How much habitat needs to be restored and what type?

  _________________________________________________________

• What timeline do you predict for ecosystem recovery based on your model?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure whether your plan is working?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan identifies key species, uses model evidence for all interventions, includes timeline and monitoring strategy, addresses multiple trophic levels
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses at least two interventions with model evidence and explains expected ecosystem effects
• Developing (2): Plan mentions conservation but doesn't justify interventions with ecosystem model evidence
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of ecosystem interactions
