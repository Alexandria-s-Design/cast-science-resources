### Title
**Can You Outsmart a Disaster? — How Science Helps Communities Survive Natural Hazards**

### Overview
Natural hazards have shaped human civilization throughout history. Modern science and engineering allow us to predict, prepare for, and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters — saving millions of lives each year. Students investigate the driving question: Why do some communities survive natural disasters better than others — what makes the difference between tragedy and resilience? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

CAN YOU OUTSMART A DISASTER?

How Science Helps Communities Survive Natural Hazards.
Why do some communities survive natural disasters better than others — what makes the difference between tragedy and resilience?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Hazard Intensity" — the strength or magnitude of the natural event — earthquake magnitude
  ○ Click "Warning Time" — how much advance notice a community receives before the hazard strikes
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Population Density" — the number of people living per square kilometer in the affected area
  ○ Click "Building Design" — how well structures are engineered to withstand the specific hazard type

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why do some communities survive natural disasters better than others — what makes the difference between tragedy and resilience?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Hazard Intensity' — that's external. The strength or magnitude of the natural event — earthquake magnitude.
Click on 'Population Density' — that's internal. The number of people living per square kilometer in the affected area.
Click on 'Warning Time' — that's external. How much advance notice a community receives before the hazard strikes.
Click on 'Building Design' — that's internal. How well structures are engineered to withstand the specific hazard type.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Hazard Intensity and Warning Time are external because they come from nature and technology systems outside the community's permanent control. Population Density and Building Design are internal because they are characteristics of the community itself that can be engineered and planned.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Warning Time" and drag an arrow to "Casualties"
• Click on "Building Design" and drag an arrow to "Property Damage"
• Click on "Population Density" and drag an arrow to "Total Impact"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Warning Time → Casualties = NEGATIVE (−)
    More warning time allows evacuation, reducing the number of people in harm's way. However, warning time doesn't protect buildings or infrastructure.

  ○ Building Design → Property Damage = NEGATIVE (−)
    Better-engineered buildings withstand more force before failing. Modern earthquake-resistant buildings can survive events that would destroy older construction.

  ○ Population Density → Total Impact = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher population density means more people and structures exposed to the hazard. The same disaster in a dense city affects far more people than in a rural area.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 1 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When warning time increases, what happens to the number of casualties? Does better building design help more against earthquakes or floods?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Warning Time' and drag an arrow
over to 'Casualties.'

Here's the key question: When warning time goes UP, does
casualties go UP or DOWN?

More warning time allows evacuation, reducing the number of people in harm's way. However, warning time doesn't protect buildings or infrastructure.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Building Design' and drag an arrow
over to 'Property Damage.'

Here's the key question: When building design goes UP, does
property damage go UP or DOWN?

Better-engineered buildings withstand more force before failing. Modern earthquake-resistant buildings can survive events that would destroy older construction.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Population Density' and drag an arrow
over to 'Total Impact.'

Here's the key question: When population density goes UP, does
total impact go UP or DOWN?

Higher population density means more people and structures exposed to the hazard. The same disaster in a dense city affects far more people than in a rural area.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 1
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When warning time increases, what happens to the number of casualties? Does better building design help more against earthquakes or floods?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Hazard Intensity is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — UNPREPARED CITY
• Poor buildings, no warning
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to casualties when there's no warning and weak buildings?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — PREPARED COMMUNITY
• Strong buildings, 48-hour warning
• PREDICT FIRST: How much difference do you predict preparation makes compared to the unprepared scenario?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — MONSTER STORM
• Maximum hazard intensity
• PREDICT FIRST: Is there a hazard level that overwhelms even the best preparation?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Warning time dramatically reduces casualties but NOT property damage — you can evacuate people but not buildings
• Building design is the most effective factor for reducing BOTH casualties and property damage
• Population density multiplies the impact — the same earthquake in a rural area vs. a dense city produces vastly different outcomes
• No amount of preparation can eliminate all risk from extreme natural hazards — but it can reduce impact by 80-90%

THE ANSWER: The difference between communities that survive disasters and those that don't comes down to three things: early warning systems (to evacuate), building codes (to withstand the hazard), and planning (to reduce population in high-risk zones). Japan and Haiti both get earthquakes, but Japan's preparation results in far fewer deaths because of decades of investment in resilient engineering and warning systems.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Unprepared City. Poor buildings, no warning.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Prepared Community.
Strong buildings, 48-hour warning.

Before you run it — make a prediction. How much difference do you predict preparation makes compared to the unprepared scenario?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Monster Storm. Maximum hazard intensity.
Is there a hazard level that overwhelms even the best preparation?

Here's what our model reveals: The difference between communities that survive disasters and those that don't comes down to three things: early warning systems (to evacuate), building codes (to withstand the hazard), and planning (to reduce population in high-risk zones). Japan and Haiti both get earthquakes, but Japan's preparation results in far fewer deaths because of decades of investment in resilient engineering and warning systems.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Hazard Intensity?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Warning Time?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Emergency Response Time — How quickly first responders can reach affected areas after a disaster strikes
   • Community Education — How well-informed residents are about hazard risks and evacuation procedures
   • Infrastructure Age — Older buildings and infrastructure are more vulnerable; newer construction follows stricter codes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Types of Natural Hazards — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Role of Data — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why did the 2010 Haiti earthquake kill 230,000 people while a stronger earthquake in Japan killed far fewer?
   • Is it possible to make a community completely disaster-proof? Why or why not?
   • How does population density change the impact of a natural hazard?
   • Should governments force people to move away from high-risk areas? What are the ethical considerations?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Emergency Response Time. How quickly first responders can reach affected areas after a disaster strikes
How would you model that?

Community Education. How well-informed residents are about hazard risks and evacuation procedures
How would you model that?

Infrastructure Age. Older buildings and infrastructure are more vulnerable; newer construction follows stricter codes
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Can You Outsmart a Disaster?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Natural hazards have shaped human civilization throughout history. Modern science and engineering allow us to predict, prepare for, and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters — saving millions of lives each year.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS3-2: Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development of technologies to mitigate their effects.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how hazard intensity, population density, warning time, and building design interact to determine disaster outcomes.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.B Natural Hazards
  Mapping the history of natural hazards in a region, combined with an understanding of related geologic forces, can help forecast the locations and likelihoods of future events.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify causal relationships between preparation levels and disaster outcomes — more warning time CAUSES fewer casualties, better building design CAUSES less structural damage.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Natural Hazard, Resilience, Mitigation, Early Warning System
□ Prepare Why do some communities survive natural disasters better than others — what makes the difference between tragedy and resilience discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify hazard intensity, population density, warning time, and building design as the key components determining disaster outcomes.
• Establish: Students determine that warning time negatively affects casualties (more warning = fewer deaths), building design negatively affects property damage (better design = less damage), and population density positively amplifies all impacts.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how preparation factors interact with hazard severity to determine overall disaster impact.
• Evaluate: Students run prepared vs. unprepared vs. extreme scenarios to quantify how much difference preparation makes.
• Revise: Students add emergency response time or community education to explore additional factors in disaster resilience.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Types of Natural Hazards:
  Major categories include: geologic hazards (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides), meteorological hazards (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts), and wildfires. Each type has specific patterns, warning signs, and mitigation strategies. Understanding these patterns is the first step in disaster preparedness.

• The Role of Data:
  Scientists use historical data, geological surveys, weather monitoring, and satellite imagery to forecast natural hazards. Earthquake recurrence intervals help predict when and where quakes will strike. Hurricane models track storms days in advance. Flood maps identify vulnerable areas. This data drives preparation decisions that save lives.

• Engineering for Resilience:
  Modern engineering provides powerful tools against natural hazards. Earthquake-resistant buildings use base isolation (floating foundations) and flexible materials. Levees and flood walls protect against flooding. Storm shelters withstand tornado-force winds. Fire-resistant materials and defensible space reduce wildfire risk. Each solution addresses a specific hazard.

• Japan vs. Haiti: A Case Study:
  The 2010 Haiti earthquake (M7.0) killed approximately 230,000 people. The 2011 Japan earthquake (M9.0 — 1000x stronger) killed approximately 20,000, mostly from the tsunami. The difference: Japan has strict building codes, tsunami warning systems, regular earthquake drills, and massive infrastructure investment. Haiti had none of these. Preparation is the difference between tragedy and resilience.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Natural disasters are unpredictable and random"
  Reality: While we can't predict the exact time of an earthquake, we CAN identify high-risk zones using historical data and geological mapping. Hurricane tracks are forecast days in advance. Flood zones are well-mapped. Most natural hazard risk is predictable and plannable.
  Strategy: Show USGS earthquake hazard maps — the patterns are clear and consistent, not random.

• "Technology can prevent natural disasters"
  Reality: Technology can't PREVENT earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods — these are natural Earth processes. But technology can predict them (seismographs, weather satellites), warn about them (alert systems), and reduce their impact (resilient engineering). Mitigation, not prevention, is the goal.
  Strategy: Ask: Can we stop an earthquake? No. Can we build a building that survives one? Yes! That's the difference.

• "All disasters affect everyone equally"
  Reality: Disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable populations — those in poverty, elderly, disabled, and communities with poor infrastructure. A hurricane causes vastly different impacts in a wealthy neighborhood vs. a low-income area. Social and economic factors multiply natural hazard impacts.
  Strategy: Compare outcomes of Hurricane Katrina across different New Orleans neighborhoods — the differences are striking.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do some communities survive natural disasters better than others — what makes the difference between tragedy and resilience?
Answer: The difference between communities that survive disasters and those that don't comes down to three things: early warning systems (to evacuate), building codes (to withstand the hazard), and planning (to reduce population in high-risk zones). Japan and Haiti both get earthquakes, but Japan's preparation results in far fewer deaths because of decades of investment in resilient engineering and warning systems.

Simulation Answers:
• Unprepared vs. Prepared: With no warning and weak buildings (10% design quality), a moderate hazard produces devastating casualties and property loss. With 48-hour warning and strong buildings (80% design), the same hazard produces 70-90% fewer casualties and 50-70% less property damage. The model proves that preparation is the single most important variable.
• Monster Storm Scenario: Even with excellent preparation, a maximum-intensity hazard still causes significant damage. No building can withstand every possible event. However, the DIFFERENCE between prepared and unprepared communities remains enormous — preparation reduces the catastrophe from existential to manageable. The model shows that preparation has diminishing returns at extreme intensities.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why the Haiti vs. Japan difference?
  A: Haiti had: no earthquake building codes, no early warning system, no earthquake drills, and extremely dense population in poorly constructed concrete buildings. Japan had: strict building codes requiring earthquake resistance, sophisticated tsunami warning systems, regular disaster drills starting in kindergarten, and massive infrastructure investment over decades. Japan's 2011 earthquake was 1000x stronger than Haiti's, yet killed 90% fewer people. The difference is entirely due to preparation.
• Q: Can a community be completely disaster-proof?
  A: No — but they can be disaster-resilient. There is no building that can survive every possible earthquake, and no warning system that works 100% of the time. However, data shows that even modest preparation can reduce casualties by 70-90%. The goal isn't to eliminate risk (impossible) but to reduce it to manageable levels. This is why risk assessment and model evidence are so important — they help communities invest limited resources where they'll save the most lives.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Disaster-Resilient Community
Mission: Design a community plan for a region that faces multiple natural hazards (earthquakes AND flooding) that minimizes casualties and property damage within a limited budget.
Scenario: A coastal city near a fault line needs a comprehensive disaster resilience plan. Your urban planning team has a $10 million budget and must decide how to allocate resources among warning systems, building upgrades, evacuation routes, and emergency shelters. Use your model evidence to justify every budget decision.
Introduction: Present the budget challenge: A coastal city on a fault line receives $10 million for disaster resilience. They face BOTH earthquake and flood risk. Your team must present a budget allocation with scientific justification for every dollar spent.

Key Concepts:
• Risk Assessment Matrix: A tool that evaluates hazards by multiplying probability × impact. High-probability, high-impact risks (like flooding in a floodplain) get the most attention and budget.
• Cost-Benefit Analysis: Comparing the cost of mitigation measures against the expected losses they prevent. If a $2M seawall prevents $50M in flood damage, the return on investment is 25:1.
• Multi-Hazard Planning: Communities often face multiple hazard types. Some investments (like warning systems) help against multiple hazards. Multi-hazard planning seeks solutions that address multiple risks simultaneously.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Budget allocation addresses both hazards, uses model evidence, includes cost-benefit reasoning, and demonstrates understanding of trade-offs
• Proficient (3): Budget addresses both hazards with model evidence and at least two mitigation strategies
• Developing (2): Budget mentions disaster preparation but doesn't justify allocations with model evidence
• Beginning (1): Budget is incomplete or doesn't connect spending decisions to natural hazard concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified risk matrix template with hazard types and probability/impact ratings
  • Use case study cards (Japan, Haiti, New Orleans) for students to analyze real examples
  • Sentence frames: 'When warning time increases, casualties __ because people can __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how FEMA flood maps are created and how they determine insurance rates
  • Investigate how climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of certain natural hazards
  • Design an early warning system for your school that addresses the most likely local natural hazard

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate cost-benefit ratios: If a $3M levee prevents $90M in flood damage, what is the return on investment?
  • ELA: Write a persuasive budget proposal to a city council arguing for specific disaster preparation investments
  • Social Studies: Research how socioeconomic factors affect which communities are most vulnerable to natural disasters

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Analyze data on natural hazard patterns to forecast future events
• Evaluate technologies designed to mitigate the effects of natural hazards
• Use evidence to compare disaster outcomes between prepared and unprepared communities

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Two cities of equal population both experience a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. City A has modern building codes while City B has older construction. City A suffers 50 casualties while City B suffers 5,000. Which factor best explains this 100x difference?
• Constructed Response: A city is located on a river floodplain and also near a fault line. The city council has $5 million for disaster preparation. Using evidence from natural hazard data, explain how you would recommend they spend the money and why.

A. A natural event (earthquake, flood, hurricane, wildfire) that threatens human life and property
B. A community's ability to prepare for, withstand, and recover from natural hazards
C. Actions taken BEFORE a disaster to reduce its impact — building codes, levees, firebreaks
D. Technology that detects hazards in advance, giving people time to prepare or evacuate

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Disaster-Resilient Community
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a community plan for a region that faces multiple natural hazards (earthquakes AND flooding) that minimizes casualties and property damage within a limited budget.

SCENARIO: A coastal city near a fault line needs a comprehensive disaster resilience plan. Your urban planning team has a $10 million budget and must decide how to allocate resources among warning systems, building upgrades, evacuation routes, and emergency shelters. Use your model evidence to justify every budget decision.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Based on your model, which investment saves the most lives: warning systems, building codes, or evacuation routes?
• How do you prioritize when the city faces BOTH earthquake and flood risk?
• What compromises must you make with a limited budget?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How will you divide the $10 million budget among different resilience strategies?

  _________________________________________________________

• Which areas of the city should be restricted from residential development?

  _________________________________________________________

• What building codes will you require for new construction?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you ensure that warning systems reach every resident, including those without smartphones?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Budget allocation addresses both hazards, uses model evidence, includes cost-benefit reasoning, and demonstrates understanding of trade-offs
• Proficient (3): Budget addresses both hazards with model evidence and at least two mitigation strategies
• Developing (2): Budget mentions disaster preparation but doesn't justify allocations with model evidence
• Beginning (1): Budget is incomplete or doesn't connect spending decisions to natural hazard concepts
