### Title
**Powered by the Sun — How Pizza, Basketball, and Your Heartbeat Are All Solar Energy**

### Overview
Students trace the energy chain from sunlight to photosynthesis to the food they eat and the activities they do. By modeling how sunlight intensity and temperature drive photosynthesis, which in turn determines how much energy is available to animals, students discover that virtually all life on Earth is running on stored solar power. This lesson creates a personal connection between the sun and students' own bodies — anchoring the energy transfer standard in something immediately relevant.

### Cover Image

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-PS3-1**: Use models to describe that energy in animals' food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body warmth) was once energy from the sun.

### Learning Objectives
- Trace the energy chain from the sun through plants to animals
- Model how sunlight intensity affects photosynthesis rate
- Explain how temperature influences plant energy production
- Predict what happens to animals when sunlight availability drops

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Sunlight Intensity | External | Amount of solar energy reaching plants (students can't control the sun) |
| Temperature | External | Ambient warmth that affects how efficiently plants photosynthesize |
| Photosynthesis Rate | Internal | How fast plants are converting sunlight to sugar/energy |
| Energy Available to Animals | Internal | How much food energy is in the ecosystem for consumers to use |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Energy Chain

### Text Editor

POWERED BY THE SUN

Here's something wild: the energy you're using RIGHT NOW to read this
sentence started as sunlight. Days ago. Maybe weeks ago. It traveled
93 million miles, hit a plant, got stored as sugar, you ate it, and
now it's powering your brain.

Every basketball game. Every heartbeat. Every thought. Solar energy.

Let's model how that chain actually works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Sunlight Intensity" — we can't turn the sun up or down
  ○ Click "Temperature" — weather controls this
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Photosynthesis Rate" — plants do this faster in better conditions
  ○ Click "Energy Available to Animals" — this is what you ultimately eat

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas
• You should now see 4 components on your screen

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• EXTERNAL = inputs from the environment (sun, temperature)
• INTERNAL = things that change BECAUSE of those inputs
• Sort them, then your teacher will continue in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your pizza. Your basketball moves. Your ability to think right now.
All of it traces back to four components you just added to your screen.
```

### Video Script

```
"The energy you're using to read this sentence started as sunlight.
Not a metaphor. Not a figure of speech. Actual solar energy, captured
by a plant, stored as sugar, eaten by you, now powering your brain.

Every time you run in gym class, every time your heart beats, every
time you think — you're running on sunshine.

Today we're going to model HOW that energy gets from the sun to your
muscles. And we're going to build it one step at a time.

Look at your component panel. Four pieces of the energy chain.

Sunlight Intensity — external. The sun decides how bright it is.
We can't turn it up or down.

Temperature — also external. Weather determines how warm it is.
Plants photosynthesize differently at 40 degrees versus 90 degrees.

Photosynthesis Rate — internal. This is what plants DO with that
sunlight and warmth. More sun, more warmth, faster photosynthesis.

Energy Available to Animals — internal. This is the end of the chain.
Plants make energy from sunlight. Animals eat plants. The energy
transfers. This component represents how much food energy exists
in the ecosystem.

Sort your components: which are external inputs? Which are internal
responses? Then click the Plus button to add each one.

You've got your pieces. Next, we're going to draw the invisible
lines that connect the sun to your next basketball game.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Wire the Energy Chain

### Text Editor

```
DRAWING THE SOLAR SUPPLY LINE

Sunlight hits a plant. The plant makes sugar. You eat the sugar.
You run. Simple — except it's not. Let's map the real connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Sunlight Intensity → Photosynthesis Rate
• Temperature → Photosynthesis Rate
• Photosynthesis Rate → Energy Available to Animals

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Sunlight Intensity → Photosynthesis Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More sunlight = MORE photosynthesis
    (Plants are solar panels — more light = more power)

  ○ Temperature → Photosynthesis Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Warmer temperatures = FASTER chemical reactions in plants
    (Too cold = plants slow down; moderate warmth = optimal)

  ○ Photosynthesis Rate → Energy Available to Animals = POSITIVE (+)
    More photosynthesis = MORE sugar/energy stored in plants
    More plant energy = MORE energy available when animals eat them

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows, all positive
• The energy flows ONE direction: sun → plants → animals

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Key insight: every positive relationship means GOOD conditions produce
more energy. But what happens when the sun disappears?
```

### Video Script

```
"Time to connect the solar supply line. Click the 'Connect' icon in
the top left.

First connection: Sunlight Intensity to Photosynthesis Rate. Think of
a plant as a solar panel. More light hits it — more electricity comes
out. Or in plant terms, more sugar gets made.

More sunlight = more photosynthesis. POSITIVE relationship. Click the
plus sign.

Second: Temperature to Photosynthesis Rate. Here's some biology that
surprises people — photosynthesis is a chemical reaction. Chemical
reactions happen faster when it's warm. A plant on a cold morning in
November is doing way less photosynthesis than the same plant in July.

Warmer temperature = faster photosynthesis. POSITIVE again.

Third: Photosynthesis Rate to Energy Available to Animals. This is
the big one. When plants photosynthesize, they make sugar — stored
energy. When animals eat plants, they get that stored energy. The
more photosynthesis happening, the more energy is packed into the
ecosystem's food supply.

More photosynthesis = more energy for animals. Positive.

Three arrows. All positive. The entire chain runs in one direction:
sun → plants → animals → you.

Now here's the big question: what happens when clouds cover the sun
for weeks? What happens in winter when days get short?

Your model is about to show you.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Energy Chain

### Text Editor

```
THE SOLAR SUPPLY LINE — LIVE

You built the energy chain. Now let's run it and test whether it
behaves like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines on the graph

STEP 2: OBSERVE NORMAL CONDITIONS
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• When Sunlight is HIGH and Temperature is warm, where is
  Photosynthesis Rate? Where is Energy Available to Animals?

STEP 3: SIMULATE WINTER (SHORT DAYS, COLD TEMPS)
• Lock Sunlight Intensity to LOW (25%)
• Lock Temperature to LOW (25%)
• Watch what happens to Photosynthesis Rate
• Watch what happens to Energy Available to Animals
• This is why animals hibernate and migrate!

STEP 4: SIMULATE A TOTAL ECLIPSE / NO SUN
• Lock Sunlight Intensity to 0%
• What happens to the entire energy chain?
• How long before Energy Available to Animals collapses?

STEP 5: BRING THE SUN BACK
• Unlock both components
• How quickly does the ecosystem recover?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• Why do ecosystems in tropical regions support more animal life?
• Why do many animals store fat before winter?
• If the sun provided half as much energy as it does now, what
  would Earth's ecosystems look like?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your energy chain is ready. Let's fire it up.

Click Play. Watch the graph. With sunlight high and temperature warm —
summer conditions — watch Photosynthesis Rate. It's climbing. Plants
are converting sunlight to sugar as fast as they can.

And Energy Available to Animals? Rising right along with it. More
plant sugar = more food in the ecosystem.

This is summer. Flowers bloom. Animals are active. Baby animals are
born. The whole ecosystem is running on solar energy at full power.

Now let's simulate winter.

Lock Sunlight Intensity to 25%. Winter days are short — less daily
sunlight. Lock Temperature to 25% too. Cold reduces photosynthesis
efficiency.

Watch Photosynthesis Rate. It's dropping. Plants are slowing down.
Some are shutting down completely — that's why leaves fall. Trees
pull back and go dormant to survive winter's energy shortage.

And Energy Available to Animals? Dropping fast.

This is exactly WHY bears hibernate. WHY birds migrate. WHY squirrels
spend all fall storing nuts. The solar supply is going to shrink, and
animals that don't adapt to that don't survive winter.

Now go extreme. Lock Sunlight to zero.

Watch the cascade. Photosynthesis stops. Plant energy production halts.
Energy Available to Animals starts collapsing.

This is what scientists call an 'energy trophic cascade.' If the
bottom of the energy chain fails, everything above it fails too.

Now bring the sun back. Watch the recovery. See how quickly plants
respond to sunlight? They're always ready.

Your model just explained why life on Earth is where it is — and why
losing solar input, even temporarily, matters so much.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — NOW MAKE IT REAL

You've modeled the basic solar energy chain. But the real story has
more players, more complexity, and some surprising plot twists.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TRACE YOUR LUNCH
   • Run your simulation at full sunlight
   • Now trace your lunch backward: what did you eat today?
   • Where in the food chain was it? How many solar energy transfers happened?

2. PUSH THE LIMITS
   • What's the maximum Energy Available to Animals?
   • What combination of sunlight and temperature creates it?
   • Is there a point where Temperature gets too HOT and slows things down?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is the basic chain. Real ecosystems have more layers:

   • Water — plants need water to photosynthesize (adds to the chain!)
   • CO2 — the carbon that plants actually use to build sugar
   • Herbivores vs. Carnivores — energy transfers twice for meat-eaters
   • Human Food Systems — farms, greenhouses, grow lights
   • Deep Sea Ecosystems — some organisms run on geothermal energy, NOT the sun

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What is a food chain and how does energy flow through it?
   • What is the 10% rule in energy transfer?
   • How do producers differ from consumers?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why do you have to eat WAY more salad than steak to get the same calories?
   • How do deep-sea creatures survive without sunlight?
   • What happens to the food chain when the sun goes behind ash clouds after a volcano?
   • How are farmers using grow lights to extend the "sun" for crops?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from the list above
   • Is it internal or external?
   • Connect it. Run it. Does your model still make sense?

What does your expanded energy chain reveal?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your solar energy chain works. Sun in, plants photosynthesize,
animals get energy. The basics are solid.

But here's a mind-bending fact: if you eat a burger, only about
10% of the energy that went into growing that cow's feed is in
the burger you're eating. The other 90% got used up — by the
plant growing, by the cow moving, by body heat.

This is called the 10% rule. Every step up the food chain, you
lose 90% of the energy. Which means eating plants is MUCH more
energy efficient than eating meat.

Your model has one energy step. Reality has many.

So let's expand it. First, play with what you have. Max out
sunlight and temperature. What's the highest Energy Available
to Animals gets? Is there a limit?

Now think: what's MISSING?

Water. Plants need water to run photosynthesis. No water =
no photosynthesis, even in full sunlight. Where does water fit?

CO2. Plants don't just need light and warmth — they pull carbon
dioxide from the air to build their sugar molecules. Less CO2
in the air could actually slow photosynthesis.

Here's a wild one: Deep sea creatures. They live in total darkness,
miles below the surface, where sunlight NEVER reaches. How do they
get energy? They use heat from volcanic vents — geothermal energy.
These ecosystems exist completely outside your model.

Pick one thing to research. Add it to your model. Run the simulation.

Does adding water change the story? Does CO2 change the outcome?

Science is never done. Models are never complete. But each version
gets closer to the truth.

What does YOUR expanded energy chain look like?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚡ CAREER CONNECTION: SPORTS NUTRITIONIST / EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sports Nutritionists and Exercise Physiologists work with professional
athletes to optimize exactly what you modeled today — how food energy
gets converted into athletic performance. They design eating plans that
time energy intake to match training and competition schedules, and they
study how different foods release energy at different rates.

Exercise Physiologists measure oxygen consumption, muscle metabolism,
and calorie burn to understand how efficiently athletes convert food
energy (stored solar energy!) into movement. Their work helps teams
win championships and helps ordinary people maintain healthy energy levels.

💰 SALARY: $55,000 - $90,000 per year (higher for pro sports teams)

The energy chain you modeled today — sun → plant → food → body →
motion — is exactly what these professionals optimize every day.
Your model is the foundation of sports science.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: Powered by the Sun
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson creates a personal, visceral connection between the sun
and students' own bodies. By tracing the energy chain from sunlight
to photosynthesis to food to movement, students internalize the
5-PS3-1 standard in a way that sticks. The winter scenario creates
a powerful "aha" moment about why animals hibernate and migrate.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-PS3-1: Use models to describe that energy in animals' food was
once energy from the sun.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: bring in food labels to trace calories back to plant energy
□ Review vocabulary: photosynthesis, energy transfer, producer, consumer

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Plants get energy from soil" → Plants get MINERALS from soil, but
  their energy comes from sunlight via photosynthesis
• "Animals make their own energy" → Animals get all their energy from
  food (which ultimately comes from the sun via photosynthesis)
• "The sun is optional for life" → With very few exceptions (deep sea
  thermal vents), all life on Earth depends on solar energy

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Open with "What did you eat for lunch?" and then ask them
  to trace it back. This hooks students immediately.
• Activity 2: Emphasize that the three positive relationships mean the
  whole chain rises and falls TOGETHER — it's connected.
• Activity 3: The winter scenario is the power moment. Let students
  watch the collapse in silence, then ask "What animals does this explain?"
• Activity 4: The 10% rule is a great extension that can shift students'
  thinking about food choices and sustainability.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "If you ate nothing but meat, how many more sunlight-to-food steps
  did your food go through?"
• "Why do deserts have fewer large animals than rainforests?"
• "How is a fossil fuel like coal actually stored solar energy from
  millions of years ago?"
• "If you were designing life on another planet, what would you use
  instead of sunlight as the energy source?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Matter cycling unit → Photosynthesis also cycles carbon between air and plants
• Ecosystems → Energy pyramids and why higher trophic levels have fewer individuals
• Climate → Fossil fuels as ancient stored solar energy

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student trace the energy path from sun to their own movement?
• Does student's model correctly show all positive relationships?
• Did student connect the winter scenario to real animal behaviors?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide pre-labeled diagram of energy chain to fill in
Challenge: Research and model the 10% rule with numbers; add a second consumer level
ELL: Use visual food chain diagram; allow drawing to explain energy transfer
