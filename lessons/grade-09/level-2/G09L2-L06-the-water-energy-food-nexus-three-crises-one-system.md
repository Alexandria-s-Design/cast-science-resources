### Title
**The Water-Energy-Food Nexus: Three Crises, One System — Modeling Coupled Resource Systems Under Population Pressure**

### Overview
Water, energy, and food are often managed by separate agencies with separate budgets. But they share the same finite resources, and decisions in one system cascade through the others. Students investigate the driving question: Why does solving one resource crisis often make another worse? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE WATER-ENERGY-FOOD NEXUS: THREE CRISES, ONE SYSTEM

Modeling Coupled Resource Systems Under Population Pressure.
Why does solving one resource crisis often make another worse?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Water Availability" — total freshwater accessible for human use from rivers
  ○ Click "Population Demand" — the total resource consumption driven by population size and per-capita usage
  ○ Click "Wastewater Recycling" — the percentage of used water that is treated and returned to the supply for reuse
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Energy Production" — total energy generated from all sources including fossil fuels
  ○ Click "Agricultural Output" — total food production from crops and livestock in a region
  ○ Click "Industrial Usage" — water and energy consumed by manufacturing

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 6 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why does solving one resource crisis often make another worse?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Water Availability' — that's external. Total freshwater accessible for human use from rivers.
Click on 'Energy Production' — that's internal. Total energy generated from all sources including fossil fuels.
Click on 'Agricultural Output' — that's internal. Total food production from crops and livestock in a region.
Click on 'Population Demand' — that's external. The total resource consumption driven by population size and per-capita usage.
Click on 'Industrial Usage' — that's internal. Water and energy consumed by manufacturing.
Click on 'Wastewater Recycling' — that's external. The percentage of used water that is treated and returned to the supply for reuse.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Water Availability, Population Demand, and Wastewater Recycling are external because they can be directly influenced by policy and infrastructure investment. Energy Production, Agricultural Output, and Industrial Usage are internal system responses to the external conditions.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 6 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Population Demand" and drag an arrow to "Water Availability"
• Click on "Water Availability" and drag an arrow to "Energy Production"
• Click on "Water Availability" and drag an arrow to "Agricultural Output"
• Click on "Energy Production" and drag an arrow to "Water Availability"
• Click on "Agricultural Output" and drag an arrow to "Water Availability"
• Click on "Wastewater Recycling" and drag an arrow to "Water Availability"
• Click on "Population Demand" and drag an arrow to "Energy Production"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Population Demand → Water Availability = NEGATIVE (−)
    More people consume more water, reducing availability.

  ○ Water Availability → Energy Production = POSITIVE (+)
    More available water supports power plant cooling and hydroelectric generation.

  ○ Water Availability → Agricultural Output = POSITIVE (+)
    More water enables more irrigation and crop production.

  ○ Energy Production → Water Availability = NEGATIVE (−)
    Energy production consumes water for cooling, reducing availability.

  ○ Agricultural Output → Water Availability = NEGATIVE (−)
    Agriculture is the largest water consumer, depleting supply.

  ○ Wastewater Recycling → Water Availability = POSITIVE (+)
    Recycling treated water returns it to supply, increasing availability.

  ○ Population Demand → Energy Production = POSITIVE (+)
    More people drive higher energy demand and production.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 7 arrows total
• 3 negative relationship(s), 4 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If you increase Energy Production to meet Population Demand, what happens to Water Availability? If Water drops, what happens to Agricultural Output? How do you solve all three simultaneously?
```

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Population Demand' and drag an arrow
over to 'Water Availability.'

Here's the key question: When population demand goes UP, does
water availability go UP or DOWN?

More people consume more water, reducing availability.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Water Availability' and drag an arrow
over to 'Energy Production.'

Here's the key question: When water availability goes UP, does
energy production go UP or DOWN?

More available water supports power plant cooling and hydroelectric generation.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Water Availability' and drag an arrow
over to 'Agricultural Output.'

Here's the key question: When water availability goes UP, does
agricultural output go UP or DOWN?

More water enables more irrigation and crop production.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Energy Production' and drag an arrow
over to 'Water Availability.'

Here's the key question: When energy production goes UP, does
water availability go UP or DOWN?

Energy production consumes water for cooling, reducing availability.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Agricultural Output' and drag an arrow
over to 'Water Availability.'

Here's the key question: When agricultural output goes UP, does
water availability go UP or DOWN?

Agriculture is the largest water consumer, depleting supply.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Wastewater Recycling' and drag an arrow
over to 'Water Availability.'

Here's the key question: When wastewater recycling goes UP, does
water availability go UP or DOWN?

Recycling treated water returns it to supply, increasing availability.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Population Demand' and drag an arrow
over to 'Energy Production.'

Here's the key question: When population demand goes UP, does
energy production go UP or DOWN?

More people drive higher energy demand and production.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 3 negative and 4
positive relationships. 7 arrows total.

If you increase Energy Production to meet Population Demand, what happens to Water Availability? If Water drops, what happens to Agricultural Output? How do you solve all three simultaneously?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Water Availability is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — GROWING CITY
• Population +30 percent over decade
• PREDICT FIRST: Which resource bottleneck appears first as population grows?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — DROUGHT
• Water -40 percent sudden reduction
• PREDICT FIRST: When water drops, does energy or food fail first?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — CIRCULAR ECONOMY
• Wastewater recycling at 90 percent
• PREDICT FIRST: Can recycling break the competition between water users?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Water, energy, and food systems are so interconnected that solving one crisis in isolation can worsen the others
• Energy production is the largest industrial water consumer -- power plants use more water than agriculture in many regions
• Population growth creates compounding pressure because each additional person demands ALL three resources simultaneously
• Circular economy approaches like wastewater recycling can partially decouple the systems and reduce competition

THE ANSWER: Solving one crisis worsens another because water, energy, and food systems share the same finite resources. Growing more food requires more water AND more energy for irrigation. Producing more energy requires water for cooling. Increasing water treatment requires energy. Population growth multiplies all demands simultaneously. Only integrated nexus thinking that optimizes all three systems together can avoid the trap of solving one problem by creating two more.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Growing City. Population +30 percent over decade.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Drought.
Water -40 percent sudden reduction.

Before you run it — make a prediction. When water drops, does energy or food fail first?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Circular Economy. Wastewater recycling at 90 percent.
Can recycling break the competition between water users?

Here's what our model reveals: Solving one crisis worsens another because water, energy, and food systems share the same finite resources. Growing more food requires more water AND more energy for irrigation. Producing more energy requires water for cooling. Increasing water treatment requires energy. Population growth multiplies all demands simultaneously. Only integrated nexus thinking that optimizes all three systems together can avoid the trap of solving one problem by creating two more.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Water Availability?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Population Demand?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Wastewater Recycling?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Desalination Capacity — Energy-intensive conversion of seawater to freshwater, trading energy for water
   • Renewable Energy Fraction — Percentage of energy from low-water sources like solar and wind
   • Urban Agriculture — Food production within city limits using vertical farms and hydroponics

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Water for Energy — how does this connect to your model?
   • Energy for Water — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model show that resource crises are interconnected rather than independent?
   • Why does optimizing one resource in isolation often make another worse?
   • What role does Wastewater Recycling play in decoupling the competing systems?
   • How does population growth create compounding rather than linear pressure?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 6 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Desalination Capacity. Energy-intensive conversion of seawater to freshwater, trading energy for water
How would you model that?

Renewable Energy Fraction. Percentage of energy from low-water sources like solar and wind
How would you model that?

Urban Agriculture. Food production within city limits using vertical farms and hydroponics
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Water-Energy-Food Nexus: Three Crises, One System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Water, energy, and food are often managed by separate agencies with separate budgets. But they share the same finite resources, and decisions in one system cascade through the others.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS3-4, HS-ETS1-2: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems. Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
  Students design integrated resource management solutions that account for coupled system dynamics.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.A Natural Resources
  Water, energy, and food systems share finite resources, creating trade-offs that require integrated management as demand grows.
• Crosscutting Concept: Systems and System Models
  Students model how coupled subsystems create emergent trade-offs not visible when each system is analyzed in isolation.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Nexus Thinking, Resource Trade-off, Carrying Capacity, Circular Economy
□ Prepare Why does solving one resource crisis often make another worse discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify water availability, energy production, agricultural output, population demand, industrial usage, and wastewater recycling as nexus components.
• Establish: Students map bidirectional connections: energy needs water, water needs energy, food needs both, population drives all demand.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing coupled resource competition and identify leverage points for sustainable management.
• Evaluate: Students run growth, drought, and recycling scenarios to test how different interventions affect all three systems.
• Revise: Students add desalination, renewable energy, or urban agriculture to explore decoupling strategies.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Water for Energy:
  Thermoelectric power plants use 40 percent of US freshwater withdrawals for cooling. Even natural gas plants need water. Only solar PV and wind require minimal water.

• Energy for Water:
  Moving, treating, and heating water consumes 13 percent of US electricity. Desalination is extremely energy-intensive at 3-4 kWh per cubic meter.

• Water for Food:
  Agriculture uses 70 percent of global freshwater. Irrigated agriculture produces 40 percent of food on 20 percent of farmland.

• Population Multiplier:
  Each additional person needs all three resources simultaneously. A city growing 50 percent needs roughly 50 percent more of everything, but the interactions make it more than 50 percent due to coupling.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Water, energy, and food are separate problems"
  Reality: They share the same finite resources. Energy production is the largest industrial water consumer. Agriculture uses 70 percent of freshwater. Solving one in isolation often makes another worse.
  Strategy: Example: California desalination solves water but requires massive energy. Texas fracking provides energy but drains aquifers. They are ONE system.

• "Technology will solve resource scarcity"
  Reality: Technology can improve efficiency but cannot create resources from nothing. Desalination makes water but needs energy. Solar panels need water to manufacture. Every solution has trade-offs within the nexus.
  Strategy: Ask: If every solution requires another resource as input, can technology alone solve scarcity?

• "Population growth creates linear resource pressure"
  Reality: Population growth creates COMPOUNDING pressure because each person needs ALL three resources, and the coupling means shortages cascade. A 50 percent population increase creates more than 50 percent more demand due to system interactions.
  Strategy: Model it: Add 50 percent population and watch the cascade. Total system stress increases by more than 50 percent.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why does solving one resource crisis often make another worse?
Answer: Solving one crisis worsens another because water, energy, and food systems share the same finite resources. Growing more food requires more water AND more energy for irrigation. Producing more energy requires water for cooling. Increasing water treatment requires energy. Population growth multiplies all demands simultaneously. Only integrated nexus thinking that optimizes all three systems together can avoid the trap of solving one problem by creating two more.

Simulation Answers:
• Growing City: As Population Demand increases 30 percent, Water Availability drops due to all sectors competing. Energy Production strains because power plants need water. Agricultural Output falls as irrigation water is diverted to cities. The bottleneck is water -- it limits both other systems.
• Circular Economy: At 90 percent wastewater recycling, water competition decreases significantly. Energy and agriculture both benefit from more available water. However, recycling itself requires energy, creating a smaller secondary trade-off. Net effect is strongly positive.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why do resource crises come in threes?
  A: The model shows water, energy, and food share finite resources. Increasing one consumption necessarily decreases supply for others. Population growth multiplies all demands simultaneously, and coupling means each shortage cascades into the others.
• Q: How does recycling help?
  A: Wastewater recycling partially decouples systems by returning water to supply instead of losing it. This reduces competition between energy, agriculture, and households. But recycling requires energy, so it shifts rather than eliminates the trade-off.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Sustainable City Resource Plan
Mission: Design an integrated water-energy-food management plan for a growing city that avoids resource trade-off traps.
Scenario: A city of 2 million is expected to grow to 3 million in 15 years. Water supply is already strained, energy costs are rising, and surrounding farmland is being developed. Design a plan that meets all three resource needs sustainably.
Introduction: A growing city faces simultaneous water, energy, and food challenges. Students design integrated plans that avoid solving one crisis by creating another.

Key Concepts:
• Nexus Analysis: Modeling resource flows reveals hidden dependencies. A water policy IS an energy policy because they share infrastructure.
• Circular Resource Flows: Wastewater recycling, waste-to-energy, and food waste composting create circular flows that reduce total demand.
• Adaptive Management: Plans must adapt to changing conditions like drought or population surges. Static solutions fail in dynamic systems.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses all three resources simultaneously, quantifies trade-offs, includes circular economy strategies, and adapts to scenarios like drought
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses multiple resources, identifies key trade-offs, and includes sustainable strategies
• Developing (2): Plan addresses resources but does not account for their interconnections or trade-offs
• Beginning (1): Plan addresses only one resource or does not use model evidence

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn Venn diagram showing water-energy-food overlaps with specific examples in each intersection
  • Use a household budget analogy: water, energy, and food are like rent, food, and transportation -- when one goes up, you have less for the others
  • Sentence frames: When we increase __ to meet demand, it requires more __ which reduces __ because __

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research Singapore water management strategy (NEWater, desalination, rainwater) and model their nexus approach
  • Calculate the water footprint of different diets (beef vs. plant-based) and model how dietary shifts affect the nexus
  • Investigate the virtual water trade -- how importing food is equivalent to importing water from other regions

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate water-energy equivalencies: if a power plant uses X gallons per MWh and a city needs Y MWh, how much water goes to energy vs. drinking?
  • ELA: Write a policy proposal for a city council that explains the nexus concept and recommends integrated resource management using model evidence.
  • Social Studies: Research water conflicts in the Middle East or Central Asia and analyze how water scarcity drives energy and food insecurity.

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how water, energy, and food production systems compete for shared resources
• Analyze trade-offs that emerge when optimizing one resource system
• Design integrated management strategies that balance competing demands

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Which intervention would MOST reduce competition between water and energy systems: (a) building more reservoirs, (b) switching to solar/wind energy, (c) importing food, (d) rationing water?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain why a city that solves its energy crisis by building natural gas plants might simultaneously worsen its water crisis.

A. An analytical approach that considers the interconnections between water, energy, and food systems rather than managing them in isolation
B. A situation where increasing the supply of one resource requires consuming more of another, creating competition between systems
C. The maximum population that a region can sustain given its water, energy, and food production capabilities
D. An economic system that minimizes waste by recycling outputs from one process as inputs to another

3. What role does Wastewater Recycling play in decoupling the competing systems?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. How does population growth create compounding rather than linear pressure?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. What trade-offs did you accept in your sustainable city design?

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Sustainable City Resource Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design an integrated water-energy-food management plan for a growing city that avoids resource trade-off traps.

SCENARIO: A city of 2 million is expected to grow to 3 million in 15 years. Water supply is already strained, energy costs are rising, and surrounding farmland is being developed. Design a plan that meets all three resource needs sustainably.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which resource bottleneck will hit first given current growth trends?
• How can circular economy approaches reduce resource competition?
• What trade-offs are you willing to accept in your plan?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How would you allocate water between energy production, agriculture, and households?

  _________________________________________________________

• What mix of energy sources minimizes water consumption?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you integrate wastewater recycling into the food production system?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would your plan adapt if drought reduces water supply by 30 percent?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses all three resources simultaneously, quantifies trade-offs, includes circular economy strategies, and adapts to scenarios like drought
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses multiple resources, identifies key trade-offs, and includes sustainable strategies
• Developing (2): Plan addresses resources but does not account for their interconnections or trade-offs
• Beginning (1): Plan addresses only one resource or does not use model evidence
