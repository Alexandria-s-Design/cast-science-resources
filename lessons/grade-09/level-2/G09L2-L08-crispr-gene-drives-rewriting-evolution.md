### Title
**CRISPR Gene Drives: Rewriting Evolution — Modeling How Engineered Genes Spread Through Wild Populations**

### Overview
CRISPR gene drives represent perhaps the most powerful and controversial biotechnology ever developed -- the ability to permanently modify an entire wild species. The potential to eliminate malaria is matched by the potential for catastrophic unintended consequences. Students investigate the driving question: Should we have the power to edit an entire species -- and what happens if we get it wrong? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 2: Advanced

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS3-1, HS-LS4-5**: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits. Evaluate evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in increases in beneficial alleles and decreases in harmful alleles.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how gene drives override normal Mendelian inheritance to spread engineered genes through populations
- Analyze how resistance evolution and fitness costs create countervailing feedback against gene drives
- Evaluate the ecological risks of releasing self-propagating genetic modifications into wild populations
- Design a gene drive deployment strategy that balances disease elimination goals with ecological safety

### Component List (Starting Model: 7 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Gene Drive Frequency | Internal | The proportion of the population carrying the engineered gene drive construct |
| Wild-Type Allele Frequency | Internal | The proportion carrying the original, unmodified gene version |
| Population Size | Internal | Total number of organisms in the target species population |
| Fitness Cost | External | The survival or reproductive disadvantage imposed by carrying the gene drive |
| Resistance Evolution | Internal | The rate at which resistance mutations arise and spread through natural selection |
| Inheritance Bias | External | The percentage of offspring that receive the gene drive, typically 95-99 percent vs. normal 50 percent |
| Ecological Impact | Internal | The cascading effects on other species when the target population is suppressed or modified |

CRISPR GENE DRIVES: REWRITING EVOLUTION

Modeling How Engineered Genes Spread Through Wild Populations.
Should we have the power to edit an entire species -- and what happens if we get it wrong?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Fitness Cost" — the survival or reproductive disadvantage imposed by carrying the gene drive
  ○ Click "Inheritance Bias" — the percentage of offspring that receive the gene drive
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Gene Drive Frequency" — the proportion of the population carrying the engineered gene drive construct
  ○ Click "Wild-Type Allele Frequency" — the proportion carrying the original
  ○ Click "Population Size" — total number of organisms in the target species population
  ○ Click "Resistance Evolution" — the rate at which resistance mutations arise and spread through natural selection
  ○ Click "Ecological Impact" — the cascading effects on other species when the target population is suppressed or modified

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 7 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Should we have the power to edit an entire species -- and what happens if we get it wrong?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Gene Drive Frequency' — that's internal. The proportion of the population carrying the engineered gene drive construct.
Click on 'Wild-Type Allele Frequency' — that's internal. The proportion carrying the original.
Click on 'Population Size' — that's internal. Total number of organisms in the target species population.
Click on 'Fitness Cost' — that's external. The survival or reproductive disadvantage imposed by carrying the gene drive.
Click on 'Resistance Evolution' — that's internal. The rate at which resistance mutations arise and spread through natural selection.
Click on 'Inheritance Bias' — that's external. The percentage of offspring that receive the gene drive, typically 95-99 percent vs.
Click on 'Ecological Impact' — that's internal. The cascading effects on other species when the target population is suppressed or modified.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Fitness Cost and Inheritance Bias are external because they are engineering parameters set by scientists. Gene Drive Frequency, Wild-Type Frequency, Population Size, Resistance Evolution, and Ecological Impact are internal evolutionary and ecological responses.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 7 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Inheritance Bias" and drag an arrow to "Gene Drive Frequency"
• Click on "Gene Drive Frequency" and drag an arrow to "Wild-Type Frequency"
• Click on "Fitness Cost" and drag an arrow to "Gene Drive Frequency"
• Click on "Gene Drive Frequency" and drag an arrow to "Resistance Evolution"
• Click on "Resistance Evolution" and drag an arrow to "Gene Drive Frequency"
• Click on "Gene Drive Frequency" and drag an arrow to "Population Size"
• Click on "Population Size" and drag an arrow to "Ecological Impact"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Inheritance Bias → Gene Drive Frequency = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher inheritance bias spreads the drive faster through the population.

  ○ Gene Drive Frequency → Wild-Type Frequency = NEGATIVE (−)
    As the drive spreads, wild-type alleles are replaced.

  ○ Fitness Cost → Gene Drive Frequency = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher fitness cost means drive carriers survive and reproduce less.

  ○ Gene Drive Frequency → Resistance Evolution = POSITIVE (+)
    As drive frequency increases, selection pressure for resistance mutations intensifies.

  ○ Resistance Evolution → Gene Drive Frequency = NEGATIVE (−)
    Resistance alleles block the drive mechanism, slowing its spread.

  ○ Gene Drive Frequency → Population Size = NEGATIVE (−)
    If the drive is suppressive, higher drive frequency reduces total population.

  ○ Population Size → Ecological Impact = POSITIVE (+)
    Population reduction cascades through food webs affecting predators, competitors, and prey.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 7 arrows total
• 4 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If a gene drive gives itself to 99 percent of offspring instead of 50 percent, how fast will it spread? But if it has a Fitness Cost, natural selection pushes back. And if Resistance Evolution occurs, the drive stalls. Who wins?
```

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Inheritance Bias' and drag an arrow
over to 'Gene Drive Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When inheritance bias goes UP, does
gene drive frequency go UP or DOWN?

Higher inheritance bias spreads the drive faster through the population.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Gene Drive Frequency' and drag an arrow
over to 'Wild-Type Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When gene drive frequency goes UP, does
wild-type frequency go UP or DOWN?

As the drive spreads, wild-type alleles are replaced.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Fitness Cost' and drag an arrow
over to 'Gene Drive Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When fitness cost goes UP, does
gene drive frequency go UP or DOWN?

Higher fitness cost means drive carriers survive and reproduce less.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Gene Drive Frequency' and drag an arrow
over to 'Resistance Evolution.'

Here's the key question: When gene drive frequency goes UP, does
resistance evolution go UP or DOWN?

As drive frequency increases, selection pressure for resistance mutations intensifies.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Resistance Evolution' and drag an arrow
over to 'Gene Drive Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When resistance evolution goes UP, does
gene drive frequency go UP or DOWN?

Resistance alleles block the drive mechanism, slowing its spread.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Gene Drive Frequency' and drag an arrow
over to 'Population Size.'

Here's the key question: When gene drive frequency goes UP, does
population size go UP or DOWN?

If the drive is suppressive, higher drive frequency reduces total population.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Population Size' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ecological Impact.'

Here's the key question: When population size goes UP, does
ecological impact go UP or DOWN?

Population reduction cascades through food webs affecting predators, competitors, and prey.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 4 negative and 3
positive relationships. 7 arrows total.

If a gene drive gives itself to 99 percent of offspring instead of 50 percent, how fast will it spread? But if it has a Fitness Cost, natural selection pushes back. And if Resistance Evolution occurs, the drive stalls. Who wins?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Fitness Cost is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — IDEAL DRIVE
• 99 percent inheritance, no fitness cost
• PREDICT FIRST: How many generations until the drive reaches 100 percent of the population?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — REALISTIC DRIVE
• 95 percent inheritance, moderate fitness cost
• PREDICT FIRST: Does the drive still reach fixation, or does natural selection slow it?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — RESISTANCE CHALLENGE
• 95 percent inheritance, moderate cost, high resistance rate
• PREDICT FIRST: Can resistance alleles outcompete the gene drive?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Gene drives exploit a mathematical advantage: 95-99 percent inheritance vs 50 percent overcomes even moderate fitness costs
• Resistance evolution is inevitable given enough time and population size -- the question is whether suppression occurs first
• Ecological impacts cascade unpredictably because removing one species affects all species connected to it in the food web
• There is a critical race between drive spread speed and resistance evolution speed that determines success or failure

THE ANSWER: Gene drives rewrite evolution by cheating inheritance -- giving themselves to 95-99 percent of offspring instead of 50 percent. This mathematical advantage can push an engineered gene through an entire wild population in just 10-20 generations. But evolution fights back: resistance mutations arise naturally, and fitness costs slow the drive. The outcome is a race between the drive spreading and resistance evolving. If we release a gene drive to eliminate malaria mosquitoes and resistance stops it halfway, we have modified a species without achieving our goal -- with unknown ecological consequences.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Ideal Drive. 99 percent inheritance, no fitness cost.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Realistic Drive.
95 percent inheritance, moderate fitness cost.

Before you run it — make a prediction. Does the drive still reach fixation, or does natural selection slow it?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Resistance Challenge. 95 percent inheritance, moderate cost, high resistance rate.
Can resistance alleles outcompete the gene drive?

Here's what our model reveals: Gene drives rewrite evolution by cheating inheritance -- giving themselves to 95-99 percent of offspring instead of 50 percent. This mathematical advantage can push an engineered gene through an entire wild population in just 10-20 generations. But evolution fights back: resistance mutations arise naturally, and fitness costs slow the drive. The outcome is a race between the drive spreading and resistance evolving. If we release a gene drive to eliminate malaria mosquitoes and resistance stops it halfway, we have modified a species without achieving our goal -- with unknown ecological consequences.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Fitness Cost?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Inheritance Bias?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Daisy Chain Mechanism — A self-limiting gene drive design where the drive loses power after a set number of generations
   • Off-Target Species Effects — The probability of the gene drive accidentally transferring to related species through hybridization
   • Community Consent Level — The degree of informed consent from local communities where the gene drive would be released

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model show the race between gene drive spread and resistance evolution?
   • Why is ecological impact the hardest component to predict in your model?
   • What ethical considerations arise when one country releases a gene drive that could cross borders?
   • How would you decide whether the benefit of eliminating malaria outweighs the ecological risk?

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 7 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Daisy Chain Mechanism. A self-limiting gene drive design where the drive loses power after a set number of generations
How would you model that?

Off-Target Species Effects. The probability of the gene drive accidentally transferring to related species through hybridization
How would you model that?

Community Consent Level. The degree of informed consent from local communities where the gene drive would be released
How would you model that?

TEACHER GUIDE: CRISPR Gene Drives: Rewriting Evolution
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
CRISPR gene drives represent perhaps the most powerful and controversial biotechnology ever developed -- the ability to permanently modify an entire wild species. The potential to eliminate malaria is matched by the potential for catastrophic unintended consequences.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS3-1, HS-LS4-5: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits. Evaluate evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in increases in beneficial alleles and decreases in harmful alleles.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Engaging in Argument from Evidence
  Students evaluate competing claims about gene drive safety using model evidence and population genetics principles.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS3.A Inheritance of Traits
  Gene drives exploit the molecular mechanism of inheritance to bias allele transmission, overriding Mendelian ratios.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students model how an engineered cause (biased inheritance) produces population-level effects that cascade through ecosystems.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Gene Drive, Mendelian Inheritance, Fitness Cost, Resistance Allele
□ Prepare Should we have the power to edit an entire species -- and what happens if we get it wrong discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify gene drive frequency, wild-type allele, population size, fitness cost, resistance evolution, inheritance bias, and ecological impact as components.
• Establish: Students map the competition between drive spread (powered by inheritance bias) and natural selection (powered by fitness cost and resistance).
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how gene drive dynamics play out across generations with competing evolutionary forces.
• Evaluate: Students run ideal, realistic, and resistance scenarios to identify conditions for drive success or failure.
• Revise: Students add daisy chain mechanisms, off-target effects, or community consent to explore safety and ethics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• How Gene Drives Work:
  Normal inheritance gives each allele a 50 percent chance of being passed on. Gene drives use CRISPR to cut the chromosome without the drive and paste a copy of the drive into the break. The result: 95-99 percent of offspring inherit the drive instead of 50 percent.

• The Malaria Application:
  Anopheles mosquitoes kill 600,000 people per year by transmitting Plasmodium parasites. A gene drive could either suppress mosquito populations or modify them to be unable to carry the parasite. Either approach could save hundreds of thousands of lives annually.

• Resistance Evolution:
  Natural selection never stops. Any mutation that prevents the drive from copying itself will be strongly favored by selection. Lab experiments show resistance evolving within 10-25 generations. The question is whether the drive suppresses the population before resistance spreads.

• Ecological Cascades:
  Mosquitoes are food for birds, bats, fish, and dragonflies. They pollinate some plants. Removing them could cascade through food webs in unpredictable ways. Or the ecological gap might be filled by other insects. We do not know -- and we cannot un-release a gene drive.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Gene drives are permanent and unstoppable"
  Reality: Gene drives face evolutionary pressure from resistance mutations. Lab experiments show resistance evolving within 10-25 generations. The drive can stall or fail. However, even partial spread may cause irreversible ecological changes.
  Strategy: Show the resistance scenario: the drive does not reach 100 percent. But it still changed 80 percent of the population. Is that reversible?

• "Removing mosquitoes would have no ecological effect"
  Reality: Mosquitoes are food for birds, bats, dragonflies, and fish. They pollinate some plants. Their larvae filter water. Removing them could cascade through food webs. Or the gap could be filled by other species. We genuinely do not know.
  Strategy: List all the species that eat mosquitoes. Now imagine those species lose 80 percent of their food. What happens next in the food chain?

• "CRISPR gene drives are precise and controllable"
  Reality: CRISPR is remarkably precise but not perfect. Off-target cuts occur, resistance evolves, and mechanisms can fail unpredictably. Lab experiments show gene drives reaching only 60-80 percent effectiveness before resistance plateaus the effect.
  Strategy: Show lab data: gene drives in contained mosquito populations stalled at 60-80 percent. What does that mean for a continental release?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Should we have the power to edit an entire species -- and what happens if we get it wrong?
Answer: Gene drives rewrite evolution by cheating inheritance -- giving themselves to 95-99 percent of offspring instead of 50 percent. This mathematical advantage can push an engineered gene through an entire wild population in just 10-20 generations. But evolution fights back: resistance mutations arise naturally, and fitness costs slow the drive. The outcome is a race between the drive spreading and resistance evolving. If we release a gene drive to eliminate malaria mosquitoes and resistance stops it halfway, we have modified a species without achieving our goal -- with unknown ecological consequences.

Simulation Answers:
• Ideal Drive: With 99 percent inheritance and zero fitness cost, the drive reaches fixation in 10-15 generations. Wild-type alleles are completely replaced. No resistance evolves because there is no selection pressure for it when fitness cost is zero.
• Resistance Challenge: With high resistance mutation rate, resistance alleles spread through the population as the gene drive creates strong selection pressure for them. The drive stalls at 60-80 percent frequency. The population is modified but not suppressed, with unknown ecological consequences.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Who wins: drive or evolution?
  A: The outcome depends on three parameters: inheritance bias, fitness cost, and resistance mutation rate. If inheritance bias greatly exceeds fitness cost and resistance is slow, the drive wins. If resistance evolves fast enough, evolution wins. The model shows this is a quantitative race, not a guaranteed outcome.
• Q: Why is 80 percent suppression possibly worse than 100 percent?
  A: At 80 percent, the population is severely disrupted but not eliminated. Ecosystem effects are triggered but the disease vector still exists. Resistance alleles stabilize at this point, making further suppression impossible. You get the ecological costs without the disease elimination benefit.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Gene Drive Safety Protocol
Mission: Design a gene drive deployment strategy for malaria mosquito suppression that maximizes disease reduction while minimizing ecological risk.
Scenario: Malaria kills 600,000 people per year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa. A gene drive targeting Anopheles mosquitoes could potentially eliminate malaria. But the ecological consequences of removing a species are unknown. Design a phased deployment with safety mechanisms.
Introduction: Malaria kills 600,000 per year. Gene drives could eliminate it. But the technology is irreversible once released. Students design the safest possible deployment strategy.

Key Concepts:
• Self-Limiting Drives: Daisy chain designs lose drive power after a set number of generations, providing temporal containment.
• Phased Deployment: Testing in contained environments, then islands, then mainland reduces risk but delays benefits.
• Ecological Monitoring: Tracking predator and pollinator populations near release sites detects cascading effects early.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Strategy includes containment mechanisms, phased deployment, ecological monitoring, halt criteria, community consent, and model-justified parameter choices
• Proficient (3): Strategy includes safety mechanisms, monitoring plan, and addresses ecological risk with model evidence
• Developing (2): Strategy includes some safety measures but lacks ecological monitoring or justified parameters
• Beginning (1): Strategy is incomplete or does not address resistance, ecological risk, or safety

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn Punnett squares comparing normal 50-50 inheritance to 95 percent gene drive inheritance
  • Use a relay race analogy: the gene drive runs at 95 mph and resistance runs at 50 mph, but resistance gets a head start
  • Sentence frames: If Inheritance Bias is __ and Fitness Cost is __, the drive will spread at __ rate because __

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the Target Malaria project in Burkina Faso and evaluate their phased approach against your model predictions
  • Model a reversal drive designed to undo the original gene drive and analyze whether reversal is practically achievable
  • Investigate the legal and sovereignty questions: who decides whether to release a gene drive that will cross national borders?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the probability of resistance arising in a population of 10 million mosquitoes if the per-generation mutation rate is 0.001 percent. How many generations until resistance is likely?
  • ELA: Write a debate speech either FOR or AGAINST gene drive release for malaria elimination, using model evidence and ethical reasoning.
  • Social Studies: Research the ethics of testing powerful biotechnologies in developing nations. Who bears the risk? Who reaps the benefit? Who decides?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how gene drives override Mendelian inheritance to spread through populations
• Analyze the competing dynamics of drive spread, fitness cost, and resistance evolution
• Evaluate ecological and ethical implications of releasing self-propagating genetic modifications

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A gene drive with 95 percent inheritance bias and moderate fitness cost is released. What MOST determines whether it succeeds: (a) initial release size, (b) resistance mutation rate, (c) population mobility, (d) weather?
• Constructed Response: Explain why a gene drive that eliminates 80 percent of malaria mosquitoes but then stalls due to resistance might be worse than one that eliminates 100 percent.

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Gene Drive                    
___ Mendelian Inheritance         
___ Fitness Cost                  
___ Resistance Allele             

A. A genetic engineering technology that biases inheritance so an engineered gene is passed to nearly all offspring rather than the normal 50 percent
B. The standard pattern where each parent contributes one allele with a 50 percent chance of passing either to offspring
C. A reduction in survival or reproduction caused by carrying an engineered gene, which natural selection acts against
D. A naturally occurring or spontaneous mutation that prevents the gene drive from copying itself, allowing normal inheritance to resume

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Gene Drive Safety Protocol
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a gene drive deployment strategy for malaria mosquito suppression that maximizes disease reduction while minimizing ecological risk.

SCENARIO: Malaria kills 600,000 people per year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa. A gene drive targeting Anopheles mosquitoes could potentially eliminate malaria. But the ecological consequences of removing a species are unknown. Design a phased deployment with safety mechanisms.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What safety mechanisms would prevent the drive from spreading beyond the target area?
• How would you monitor for resistance evolution and ecological cascades?
• At what point would you halt deployment if unexpected effects occur?

DESIGN THINKING:
• Would you use a suppression drive (reduce population) or modification drive (make mosquitoes unable to carry malaria)?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you contain the drive to a specific geographic region?

  _________________________________________________________

• What monitoring systems would detect ecological side effects?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you obtain informed consent from communities where the drive is released?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Strategy includes containment mechanisms, phased deployment, ecological monitoring, halt criteria, community consent, and model-justified parameter choices
• Proficient (3): Strategy includes safety mechanisms, monitoring plan, and addresses ecological risk with model evidence
• Developing (2): Strategy includes some safety measures but lacks ecological monitoring or justified parameters
• Beginning (1): Strategy is incomplete or does not address resistance, ecological risk, or safety
