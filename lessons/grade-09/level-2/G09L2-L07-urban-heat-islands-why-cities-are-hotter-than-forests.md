### Title
**Urban Heat Islands: Why Cities Are Hotter Than Forests — Modeling How Built Environments Amplify Extreme Heat**

### Overview
Urban heat islands are not just uncomfortable -- they are deadly. Heat kills more Americans than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. Understanding why some neighborhoods are dangerously hotter than others requires modeling the physics of the built environment. Students investigate the driving question: Why can a city be 10 degrees hotter than the forest just 20 miles away, and who suffers most? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

URBAN HEAT ISLANDS: WHY CITIES ARE HOTTER THAN FORESTS

Modeling How Built Environments Amplify Extreme Heat.
Why can a city be 10 degrees hotter than the forest just 20 miles away, and who suffers most?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Impervious Surface Area" — percentage of land covered by heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt
  ○ Click "Green Space Coverage" — percentage of land covered by vegetation including trees
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Ambient Temperature" — the local air temperature experienced at ground level in different neighborhoods
  ○ Click "Energy Consumption (AC)" — electricity used for air conditioning
  ○ Click "Air Quality Index" — measure of air pollution concentration
  ○ Click "Heat-Related Health Risk" — probability of heat stroke

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 6 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why can a city be 10 degrees hotter than the forest just 20 miles away, and who suffers most?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Impervious Surface Area' — that's external. Percentage of land covered by heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt.
Click on 'Green Space Coverage' — that's external. Percentage of land covered by vegetation including trees.
Click on 'Ambient Temperature' — that's internal. The local air temperature experienced at ground level in different neighborhoods.
Click on 'Energy Consumption (AC)' — that's internal. Electricity used for air conditioning.
Click on 'Air Quality Index' — that's internal. Measure of air pollution concentration.
Click on 'Heat-Related Health Risk' — that's internal. Probability of heat stroke.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Impervious Surface Area and Green Space Coverage are external because they represent land-use decisions that planners can modify. Ambient Temperature, AC Energy Consumption, Air Quality, and Health Risk are internal system responses.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 6 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Impervious Surface" and drag an arrow to "Ambient Temperature"
• Click on "Green Space" and drag an arrow to "Ambient Temperature"
• Click on "Ambient Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Energy Consumption"
• Click on "Energy Consumption" and drag an arrow to "Ambient Temperature"
• Click on "Ambient Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Air Quality"
• Click on "Ambient Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Health Risk"
• Click on "Air Quality" and drag an arrow to "Health Risk"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Impervious Surface → Ambient Temperature = POSITIVE (+)
    More dark surfaces absorb more solar radiation, raising local temperature.

  ○ Green Space → Ambient Temperature = NEGATIVE (−)
    Vegetation cools through evapotranspiration and shade.

  ○ Ambient Temperature → Energy Consumption = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher temperatures drive more AC use.

  ○ Energy Consumption → Ambient Temperature = POSITIVE (+)
    AC pumps waste heat outdoors, creating a reinforcing loop.

  ○ Ambient Temperature → Air Quality = NEGATIVE (−)
    Heat accelerates ozone formation and traps pollutants.

  ○ Ambient Temperature → Health Risk = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher temperatures increase heat stroke, dehydration, and mortality risk.

  ○ Air Quality → Health Risk = POSITIVE (+)
    Poor air quality compounds heat-related health effects.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 7 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 5 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Impervious Surface Area is high and Green Space is low, what happens to Ambient Temperature? If temperature rises, what happens to AC use? And if AC pumps heat outside, what happens to outdoor temperature? Find the reinforcing loop.

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Impervious Surface' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ambient Temperature.'

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Impervious Surface Area is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — NEIGHBORHOOD COMPARISON
• Wealthy area vs. underserved area
• PREDICT FIRST: How much hotter is the concrete neighborhood vs. the tree-lined one?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HEAT WAVE AMPLIFICATION
• Baseline +5 C with urban heat island
• PREDICT FIRST: How much does the city amplify a regional heat wave?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — GREEN INTERVENTION
• Green space from 10 to 40 percent
• PREDICT FIRST: How much cooling does tree planting provide? Is it enough?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Urban heat islands create a reinforcing loop: heat drives AC use which pumps more heat outside which drives more AC use
• The temperature difference between wealthy and poor neighborhoods can exceed 10 degrees F due to green space inequality
• Air conditioning is both a solution and a cause -- it cools indoor spaces while warming outdoor spaces and consuming energy
• Green infrastructure breaks the reinforcing loop by providing passive cooling through evapotranspiration

THE ANSWER: Cities are hotter because dark impervious surfaces absorb solar energy, concrete stores heat and releases it at night, and removing vegetation eliminates natural cooling. This creates a reinforcing feedback loop: higher temperatures drive AC use, which pumps waste heat outdoors, raising temperatures further. The communities with the most concrete and least green space -- typically low-income neighborhoods and communities of color -- experience the worst heat. Environmental justice demands that cooling investments target the most vulnerable, not the most politically powerful.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Neighborhood Comparison. Wealthy area vs. underserved area.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Heat Wave Amplification.
Baseline +5 C with urban heat island.

Before you run it — make a prediction. How much does the city amplify a regional heat wave?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Green Intervention. Green space from 10 to 40 percent.
How much cooling does tree planting provide? Is it enough?

Here's what our model reveals: Cities are hotter because dark impervious surfaces absorb solar energy, concrete stores heat and releases it at night, and removing vegetation eliminates natural cooling. This creates a reinforcing feedback loop: higher temperatures drive AC use, which pumps waste heat outdoors, raising temperatures further. The communities with the most concrete and least green space -- typically low-income neighborhoods and communities of color -- experience the worst heat. Environmental justice demands that cooling investments target the most vulnerable, not the most politically powerful.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Impervious Surface Area?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Green Space Coverage?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Cool Roof Coverage — Percentage of buildings with reflective roofing that reduces heat absorption
   • Public Transit Usage — Percentage of commuters using public transit vs. cars, reducing vehicle waste heat
   • Nighttime Temperature — Minimum temperature at night, which fails to drop in dense urban areas due to stored heat release

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 6 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Cool Roof Coverage. Percentage of buildings with reflective roofing that reduces heat absorption
How would you model that?

Public Transit Usage. Percentage of commuters using public transit vs. cars, reducing vehicle waste heat
How would you model that?

Nighttime Temperature. Minimum temperature at night, which fails to drop in dense urban areas due to stored heat release
How would you model that?

TEACHER GUIDE: Urban Heat Islands: Why Cities Are Hotter Than Forests
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Urban heat islands are not just uncomfortable -- they are deadly. Heat kills more Americans than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. Understanding why some neighborhoods are dangerously hotter than others requires modeling the physics of the built environment.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS3-4, HS-PS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces human impacts on natural systems. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that energy transfer through heating changes particle motion.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Analyzing and Interpreting Data
  Students analyze temperature data across neighborhoods to identify patterns of heat inequality and evaluate intervention effectiveness.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS3.B Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
  Heat energy absorbed by dark surfaces is stored in thermal mass and radiated, creating measurable temperature differences between urban and rural environments.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students model how the built environment creates feedback loops that amplify heat, and how targeted interventions can break these loops.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Urban Heat Island, Albedo, Thermal Mass, Environmental Justice
□ Prepare Why can a city be 10 degrees hotter than the forest just 20 miles away, and who suffers most discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify impervious surfaces, green space, ambient temperature, AC energy consumption, air quality, and health risk as the 6 components.
• Establish: Students map the reinforcing heat-AC loop and the environmental justice dimension of heat inequality.
• Visualize: Students build a model comparing wealthy and underserved neighborhoods to reveal the structural roots of heat inequality.
• Evaluate: Students run neighborhood comparison, heat wave, and green infrastructure scenarios.
• Revise: Students add cool roofs, transit, or nighttime temperature to explore additional cooling strategies.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Physics of Urban Heat:
  Dark surfaces absorb up to 95 percent of incoming solar radiation and convert it to heat. Concrete and asphalt store this heat in their thermal mass and release it at night, preventing cooling. Vegetation cools through evapotranspiration, but cities have replaced trees with pavement.

• The AC Feedback Loop:
  Air conditioning is both salvation and curse. It cools indoor spaces but pumps waste heat outdoors, adding 1-2 degrees to local air temperature in dense areas. Higher outdoor temperatures drive more AC use, which pumps more heat, creating a reinforcing loop.

• Environmental Justice:
  Heat vulnerability maps closely mirror poverty and racial segregation maps. Historically redlined neighborhoods have 30-40 percent less tree canopy. Low-income residents are less likely to have AC, more likely to have outdoor jobs, and more likely to have health conditions exacerbated by heat.

• Green Infrastructure Solutions:
  Trees provide shade AND evapotranspiration cooling. A single mature tree can provide the cooling equivalent of 10 room air conditioners. Cool roofs reflect solar radiation. Green roofs combine both. But these solutions take years to decades to mature.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Urban heat islands are just uncomfortable"
  Reality: Urban heat kills more people than any other weather event. The 2003 European heat wave killed 70,000 people, mostly in cities. Heat strokes, dehydration, and cardiovascular events are medical emergencies.
  Strategy: Show data: Heat kills more Americans annually than hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods combined. It is the deadliest weather.

• "AC solves the heat problem"
  Reality: AC cools individuals while warming the city. Every BTU removed from indoor spaces is pumped outdoors plus waste heat from the AC unit itself. Dense AC use can add 1-2 degrees to outdoor temperature, worsening the problem for those without AC.
  Strategy: Demonstrate: If everyone turns on AC, who benefits? Those with AC cool down. Those without AC (often the poorest) get even hotter from the waste heat.

• "Heat affects everyone equally"
  Reality: Heat vulnerability is deeply unequal. Low-income residents are less likely to have AC, more likely to work outdoors, more likely to live in heat-absorbing neighborhoods, and more likely to have pre-existing conditions. Race and income predict heat death rates better than temperature does.
  Strategy: Map it: Overlay heat data with income and race data. The correlation is not coincidence -- it is the result of decades of unequal investment.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why can a city be 10 degrees hotter than the forest just 20 miles away, and who suffers most?
Answer: Cities are hotter because dark impervious surfaces absorb solar energy, concrete stores heat and releases it at night, and removing vegetation eliminates natural cooling. This creates a reinforcing feedback loop: higher temperatures drive AC use, which pumps waste heat outdoors, raising temperatures further. The communities with the most concrete and least green space -- typically low-income neighborhoods and communities of color -- experience the worst heat. Environmental justice demands that cooling investments target the most vulnerable, not the most politically powerful.

Simulation Answers:
• Neighborhood Comparison: The high-impervious, low-green neighborhood shows temperatures 5-10 degrees higher, 40 percent more AC use, worse air quality, and significantly higher health risk. The tree-lined neighborhood stays cooler through evapotranspiration and shade, with less AC needed.
• Green Intervention: Increasing green space from 10 to 40 percent reduces ambient temperature by 3-5 degrees, cuts AC demand by 20-30 percent, improves air quality, and significantly reduces health risk. The reinforcing loop is weakened by passive cooling.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: How is urban heat self-reinforcing?
  A: Heat drives AC use, which pumps waste heat outside, making it hotter, driving more AC use. The model shows this positive feedback loop. Without intervention, the loop amplifies itself. Green infrastructure breaks the loop by providing passive cooling that does not generate waste heat.
• Q: Why is heat an environmental justice issue?
  A: The model shows that neighborhoods with more impervious surfaces and less green space are structurally hotter. These neighborhoods correlate with historically redlined, low-income, and communities of color. The heat inequality is not natural -- it was created by decades of unequal investment in urban infrastructure.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design an Equitable Urban Cooling Plan
Mission: Design a neighborhood cooling strategy that prioritizes environmental justice by targeting interventions to the most heat-vulnerable communities.
Scenario: A city has funding for urban cooling but limited budget. Some neighborhoods are 10+ degrees hotter than others. Design a plan that allocates cooling interventions equitably based on heat vulnerability, not political influence.
Introduction: A city has cooling funds but limited budget. Temperature inequality across neighborhoods exceeds 10 degrees. Students design equitable cooling plans.

Key Concepts:
• Heat Vulnerability Mapping: Combining surface temperature data with demographic data reveals which populations face the greatest heat risk.
• Green Infrastructure ROI: Trees provide decades of cooling. Cool roofs are faster to install. The optimal mix depends on budget and timeline.
• Anti-Gentrification Safeguards: Green improvements can increase property values and displace the residents they were meant to help. Plans must include safeguards.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan targets most vulnerable neighborhoods, uses model evidence for intervention selection, includes equity metrics, and addresses gentrification risk
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses heat inequality, selects appropriate interventions, and uses model evidence
• Developing (2): Plan includes cooling interventions but does not prioritize by vulnerability or address equity
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or does not connect interventions to the heat island model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn feedback loop diagram showing the heat-AC reinforcing cycle
  • Use a real thermal map of a familiar city to make the concept concrete
  • Sentence frames: Neighborhood A is hotter than B because it has more __ and less __, which means __ absorbs more heat and __ cannot cool it

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research historical redlining maps and overlay them with modern heat island data to demonstrate structural inequality
  • Calculate the number of trees needed to cool a specific neighborhood by 5 degrees and estimate the cost and timeline
  • Design a cool corridor network connecting parks through tree-lined streets to create heat refuges

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate albedo-weighted solar absorption for different surface mixes and determine the optimal ratio of cool to dark surfaces for a target temperature.
  • ELA: Write an op-ed for a local newspaper arguing that heat is a civil rights issue, using model evidence and historical context.
  • Social Studies: Research the history of urban planning decisions -- highway placement, park investment, zoning -- that created today's heat inequality.

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how impervious surfaces and green space loss create reinforcing urban heat loops
• Analyze how heat island effects disproportionately impact vulnerable communities
• Design equitable cooling interventions based on model evidence

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Which intervention would provide the MOST cooling: (a) AC for all buildings, (b) 30 percent increase in tree canopy, (c) cool roofs on commercial buildings, (d) reducing traffic?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain why a heat wave that is survivable in a suburban neighborhood with trees can be deadly in an urban neighborhood with concrete.

STUDENT ACTIVITY PACK: Urban Heat Islands: Why Cities Are Hotter Than Forests
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NAME: _________________________ DATE: _____________

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRE-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Why do you think cities are hotter than surrounding countryside?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. Have you noticed temperature differences between different neighborhoods? Why might that be?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. Draw a diagram showing how concrete, trees, and air conditioning might affect local temperature.

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Urban Heat Island             
___ Albedo                        
___ Thermal Mass                  
___ Environmental Justice         

A. A metropolitan area significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to heat-absorbing surfaces, reduced vegetation, and waste heat from buildings and vehicles
B. The reflectivity of a surface; dark surfaces like asphalt have low albedo and absorb heat, while light or vegetated surfaces have high albedo and reflect it
C. The ability of a material to absorb, store, and later release heat; concrete and asphalt store daytime heat and radiate it at night
D. The principle that no community should bear a disproportionate share of environmental hazards due to race, income, or political power

STEM CHALLENGE: Design an Equitable Urban Cooling Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a neighborhood cooling strategy that prioritizes environmental justice by targeting interventions to the most heat-vulnerable communities.

SCENARIO: A city has funding for urban cooling but limited budget. Some neighborhoods are 10+ degrees hotter than others. Design a plan that allocates cooling interventions equitably based on heat vulnerability, not political influence.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which neighborhoods should receive cooling interventions first and why?
• What mix of interventions provides the most cooling per dollar?
• How do you balance immediate relief with long-term structural change?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How would you map heat vulnerability across the city?

  _________________________________________________________

• What combination of green infrastructure and cool surfaces would you deploy?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you ensure that cooling investments do not cause gentrification?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you measure whether your plan actually reduced heat inequality?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan targets most vulnerable neighborhoods, uses model evidence for intervention selection, includes equity metrics, and addresses gentrification risk
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses heat inequality, selects appropriate interventions, and uses model evidence
• Developing (2): Plan includes cooling interventions but does not prioritize by vulnerability or address equity
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or does not connect interventions to the heat island model
