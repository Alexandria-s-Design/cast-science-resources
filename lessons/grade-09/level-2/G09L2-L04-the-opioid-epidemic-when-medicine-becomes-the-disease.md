### Title
**The Opioid Epidemic: When Medicine Becomes the Disease — Modeling Neurochemical Feedback Loops in Addiction**

### Overview
The opioid epidemic has killed over 500,000 Americans since 1999. Understanding how prescribed medicine becomes lethal addiction requires modeling neurochemical feedback loops that hijack the brain reward system. Students investigate the driving question: How does a pill prescribed by a doctor become the deadliest drug epidemic in American history? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC: WHEN MEDICINE BECOMES THE DISEASE

Modeling Neurochemical Feedback Loops in Addiction.
How does a pill prescribed by a doctor become the deadliest drug epidemic in American history?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Prescription Rate" — the frequency and dosage of opioid prescriptions in a community
  ○ Click "Social Network Exposure" — the probability of encountering opioids through community connections
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Tolerance Development" — the progressive decrease in opioid effectiveness as brain receptors adapt
  ○ Click "Addiction Level" — the degree of compulsive drug-seeking behavior driven by neurochemical dependence
  ○ Click "Dopamine Receptor Sensitivity" — the responsiveness of the brain reward system
  ○ Click "Pain Threshold" — the pain tolerance level
  ○ Click "Withdrawal Severity" — the intensity of symptoms when opioid levels drop below the adapted baseline

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 7 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How does a pill prescribed by a doctor become the deadliest drug epidemic in American history?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Prescription Rate' — that's external. The frequency and dosage of opioid prescriptions in a community.
Click on 'Tolerance Development' — that's internal. The progressive decrease in opioid effectiveness as brain receptors adapt.
Click on 'Addiction Level' — that's internal. The degree of compulsive drug-seeking behavior driven by neurochemical dependence.
Click on 'Dopamine Receptor Sensitivity' — that's internal. The responsiveness of the brain reward system.
Click on 'Social Network Exposure' — that's external. The probability of encountering opioids through community connections.
Click on 'Pain Threshold' — that's internal. The pain tolerance level.
Click on 'Withdrawal Severity' — that's internal. The intensity of symptoms when opioid levels drop below the adapted baseline.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Prescription Rate and Social Network Exposure are external because they are modifiable by policy. Tolerance, Addiction Level, Dopamine Sensitivity, Pain Threshold, and Withdrawal Severity are internal neurochemical responses.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 7 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Prescription Rate" and drag an arrow to "Tolerance"
• Click on "Tolerance" and drag an arrow to "Addiction Level"
• Click on "Addiction" and drag an arrow to "Dopamine Sensitivity"
• Click on "Dopamine Sensitivity" and drag an arrow to "Tolerance"
• Click on "Addiction" and drag an arrow to "Pain Threshold"
• Click on "Pain Threshold" and drag an arrow to "Prescription Rate"
• Click on "Social Exposure" and drag an arrow to "Addiction"
• Click on "Addiction" and drag an arrow to "Withdrawal Severity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Prescription Rate → Tolerance = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher prescriptions mean more exposure, accelerating tolerance.

  ○ Tolerance → Addiction Level = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher tolerance requires higher doses, deepening dependence.

  ○ Addiction → Dopamine Sensitivity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Increasing addiction drives receptor downregulation.

  ○ Dopamine Sensitivity → Tolerance = NEGATIVE (−)
    Less sensitive receptors mean same dose does less, driving tolerance up.

  ○ Addiction → Pain Threshold = NEGATIVE (−)
    Chronic use causes hyperalgesia, lowering pain threshold.

  ○ Pain Threshold → Prescription Rate = NEGATIVE (−)
    Lower pain thresholds drive patients to seek more medication.

  ○ Social Exposure → Addiction = POSITIVE (+)
    Greater community exposure increases non-medical use.

  ○ Addiction → Withdrawal Severity = POSITIVE (+)
    Deeper addiction produces more severe withdrawal.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 8 arrows total
• 4 negative relationship(s), 4 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Tolerance Development increases, what happens to the effective dose needed? How does this create a reinforcing feedback loop with Addiction Level?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Prescription Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Tolerance.'

Here's the key question: When prescription rate goes UP, does
tolerance go UP or DOWN?

Higher prescriptions mean more exposure, accelerating tolerance.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Tolerance' and drag an arrow
over to 'Addiction Level.'

Here's the key question: When tolerance goes UP, does
addiction level go UP or DOWN?

Higher tolerance requires higher doses, deepening dependence.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Addiction' and drag an arrow
over to 'Dopamine Sensitivity.'

Here's the key question: When addiction goes UP, does
dopamine sensitivity go UP or DOWN?

Increasing addiction drives receptor downregulation.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Dopamine Sensitivity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Tolerance.'

Here's the key question: When dopamine sensitivity goes UP, does
tolerance go UP or DOWN?

Less sensitive receptors mean same dose does less, driving tolerance up.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Addiction' and drag an arrow
over to 'Pain Threshold.'

Here's the key question: When addiction goes UP, does
pain threshold go UP or DOWN?

Chronic use causes hyperalgesia, lowering pain threshold.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Pain Threshold' and drag an arrow
over to 'Prescription Rate.'

Here's the key question: When pain threshold goes UP, does
prescription rate go UP or DOWN?

Lower pain thresholds drive patients to seek more medication.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Social Exposure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Addiction.'

Here's the key question: When social exposure goes UP, does
addiction go UP or DOWN?

Greater community exposure increases non-medical use.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Addiction' and drag an arrow
over to 'Withdrawal Severity.'

Here's the key question: When addiction goes UP, does
withdrawal severity go UP or DOWN?

Deeper addiction produces more severe withdrawal.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 4 negative and 4
positive relationships. 8 arrows total.

When Tolerance Development increases, what happens to the effective dose needed? How does this create a reinforcing feedback loop with Addiction Level?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Prescription Rate is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — SHORT-TERM USE
• Moderate prescription, 2-week duration
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to Dopamine Receptor Sensitivity after a short prescription?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — CHRONIC ESCALATION
• High prescription maintained over months
• PREDICT FIRST: At what point does Tolerance make the original dose ineffective?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — NETWORK EFFECTS
• One prescription feeds social exposure
• PREDICT FIRST: How does one person's leftover pills create new users?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Opioid tolerance creates a reinforcing feedback loop: reduced sensitivity requires higher dose which causes faster adaptation
• There is a neurochemical threshold past which dependence becomes physiological
• Chronic opioid use paradoxically INCREASES pain sensitivity via hyperalgesia
• Social network effects amplify a medical problem into an epidemic

THE ANSWER: A doctor prescribes opioids for pain. The brain adapts through tolerance as receptors become less sensitive, requiring higher doses. This triggers a reinforcing feedback loop. Past the dependence threshold, the brain is physically rewired. When prescriptions end, withdrawal drives patients to seek opioids elsewhere. Unused pills enter social networks creating new exposures. One prescription becomes a community epidemic through cascading feedback loops.
```

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Short-Term Use. Moderate prescription, 2-week duration.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Chronic Escalation.
High prescription maintained over months.

Before you run it — make a prediction. At what point does Tolerance make the original dose ineffective?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Network Effects. One prescription feeds social exposure.
How does one person's leftover pills create new users?

Here's what our model reveals: A doctor prescribes opioids for pain. The brain adapts through tolerance as receptors become less sensitive, requiring higher doses. This triggers a reinforcing feedback loop. Past the dependence threshold, the brain is physically rewired. When prescriptions end, withdrawal drives patients to seek opioids elsewhere. Unused pills enter social networks creating new exposures. One prescription becomes a community epidemic through cascading feedback loops.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Prescription Rate?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Social Network Exposure?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Naloxone Availability — Accessibility of opioid overdose reversal medication, which saves lives but does not address underlying addiction
   • Medication-Assisted Treatment Access — Availability of evidence-based treatments like methadone and buprenorphine
   • Illicit Fentanyl Contamination — Presence of ultra-potent synthetic fentanyl in the drug supply, dramatically increasing overdose risk

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Neurochemistry of Tolerance — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Dependence Threshold — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model demonstrate that addiction is a neurochemical process rather than a moral failing?
   • At what point in the feedback loop would intervention be most effective and why?
   • How do social network effects transform an individual problem into a community epidemic?
   • What are the ethical implications of modeling addiction?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 7 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Naloxone Availability. Accessibility of opioid overdose reversal medication, which saves lives but does not address underlying addiction
How would you model that?

Medication-Assisted Treatment Access. Availability of evidence-based treatments like methadone and buprenorphine
How would you model that?

Illicit Fentanyl Contamination. Presence of ultra-potent synthetic fentanyl in the drug supply, dramatically increasing overdose risk
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Opioid Epidemic: When Medicine Becomes the Disease
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The opioid epidemic has killed over 500,000 Americans since 1999. Understanding how prescribed medicine becomes lethal addiction requires modeling neurochemical feedback loops that hijack the brain reward system.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS1-2, HS-ETS1-4: Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems. Use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students build multi-feedback-loop models of neurochemical tolerance, dependence, and social network epidemic effects.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function
  The brain dopamine reward system adapts to chronic opioid exposure through receptor downregulation.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect: Mechanism and Prediction
  Students trace the causal chain from prescription to dependence to epidemic, identifying threshold effects.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Tolerance, Dependence, Dopamine Receptor Downregulation, Withdrawal
□ Prepare How does a pill prescribed by a doctor become the deadliest drug epidemic in American history discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify the 7 interacting components of the opioid crisis system.
• Establish: Students map multiple feedback loops: tolerance-dose escalation, hyperalgesia-pain-use, and social exposure-new users.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model with 7 components, identifying reinforcing loops and thresholds.
• Evaluate: Students run short-term, chronic, and community-spread scenarios to test intervention timing.
• Revise: Students add naloxone, MAT, or fentanyl contamination to model real-world interventions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Neurochemistry of Tolerance:
  Opioids bind to mu-opioid receptors, triggering dopamine release. With repeated exposure, the brain reduces receptor number and sensitivity. This is tolerance: the same dose produces less effect.

• The Dependence Threshold:
  After sufficient exposure, the brain baseline neurochemistry shifts. It now REQUIRES opioids to function normally. Without them, severe withdrawal occurs.

• Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia:
  Chronic opioid use can paradoxically INCREASE pain sensitivity. The brain compensates by amplifying pain signals, creating a second feedback loop.

• The Social Network Effect:
  Leftover pills became community exposure vectors. When prescriptions tightened, demand shifted to illicit heroin and fentanyl.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Addiction is a moral failure"
  Reality: The feedback model shows addiction is a predictable neurochemical outcome. Past the dependence threshold, willpower cannot override altered neurochemistry.
  Strategy: Ask: Does it take willpower to digest food? Tolerance and dependence are equally automatic.

• "Only certain people become addicted"
  Reality: Anyone with a brain can develop dependence. The variables are dosage, duration, and genetics, not character.
  Strategy: The opioid crisis affected every demographic equally. The feedback loop does not check your resume.

• "People take opioids to get high"
  Reality: Past the dependence threshold, people take opioids to avoid feeling terrible, not to feel good. Motivation shifts from reward-seeking to punishment-avoidance.
  Strategy: If someone needs insulin to function, are they taking it to get high?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does a pill prescribed by a doctor become the deadliest drug epidemic in American history?
Answer: A doctor prescribes opioids for pain. The brain adapts through tolerance as receptors become less sensitive, requiring higher doses. This triggers a reinforcing feedback loop. Past the dependence threshold, the brain is physically rewired. When prescriptions end, withdrawal drives patients to seek opioids elsewhere. Unused pills enter social networks creating new exposures. One prescription becomes a community epidemic through cascading feedback loops.

Simulation Answers:
• Short-Term Scenario: With moderate prescription over 2 weeks, Tolerance begins mildly. Dopamine Sensitivity recovers after cessation. System returns to baseline.
• Chronic Scenario: With sustained high-dose use, tolerance-addiction loop accelerates. System crosses dependence threshold around 4-8 weeks. Stopping produces severe withdrawal.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is addiction a disease?
  A: The model shows addiction involves physical rewiring. Tolerance and dependence are automatic biological processes. Once the threshold is crossed, medical intervention is needed.
• Q: Where is intervention most effective?
  A: Early intervention before the dependence threshold is vastly more effective. Once past the threshold, medication-assisted treatment is required.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design an Opioid Crisis Intervention Dashboard
Mission: Design a data-driven intervention system that identifies at-risk communities and recommends targeted interventions at different crisis stages.
Scenario: A state health department has $50 million to combat the opioid crisis. Your team must design a dashboard that identifies which communities need which interventions based on real-time data.
Introduction: A state health department needs a data-driven system to allocate its opioid crisis budget across communities at different epidemic stages.

Key Concepts:
• Epidemiological Surveillance: Real-time monitoring of prescription rates, ER visits, overdose deaths identifies communities at different stages.
• Intervention Staging: Prevention works early; treatment works mid-stage; harm reduction works late-stage.
• Feedback-Informed Allocation: Understanding feedback loops predicts which communities escalate fastest.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Dashboard integrates multiple data streams, stages communities, recommends interventions with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Dashboard identifies risk levels, recommends interventions with model support
• Developing (2): Dashboard shows indicators but lacks clear connection to epidemic stage
• Beginning (1): Dashboard is incomplete or disconnected from the addiction model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn diagram showing three feedback loops with labeled arrows
  • Thermostat analogy: brain tries to maintain normal but the definition keeps shifting
  • Sentence frames: When __ increases past the threshold, __ shifts because the feedback loop __

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research medication-assisted treatment and model how methadone affects tolerance and withdrawal components
  • Investigate pharmaceutical marketing role in setting initial Prescription Rates
  • Compare the US opioid epidemic to the 19th-century opium crisis in China

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate exponential growth of opioid prescriptions 1999-2012 and model overdose deaths as a lagged function.
  • ELA: Write a first-person narrative of prescription-to-dependence journey using the neurochemical model.
  • Social Studies: Research Purdue Pharma and analyze how corporate decisions affected the Prescription Rate component nationally.

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how neurochemical feedback loops drive opioid tolerance and dose escalation
• Analyze threshold dynamics that determine the transition from use to dependence
• Evaluate intervention strategies targeting different stages of the addiction feedback system

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Which feedback loop is MOST responsible for driving dose escalation?
• Constructed Response: Explain why a patient on opioids for 6 months faces a fundamentally different neurochemical situation than one on them for 2 weeks.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before you build in ModelIt, sort your components here:

EXTERNAL (can't control):
_______________ _______________ _______________

INTERNAL (changes based on other things):
_______________ _______________ _______________

Draw arrows showing relationships. Label each + or −.

REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. How does your model demonstrate that addiction is a neurochemical process rather than a moral failing?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. At what point in the feedback loop would intervention be most effective and why?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. How do social network effects transform an individual problem into a community epidemic?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. What are the ethical implications of modeling addiction?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. How does opioid-induced hyperalgesia create a particularly cruel feedback loop?

   _________________________________________________________

STEM CHALLENGE: Design an Opioid Crisis Intervention Dashboard
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a data-driven intervention system that identifies at-risk communities and recommends targeted interventions at different crisis stages.

SCENARIO: A state health department has $50 million to combat the opioid crisis. Your team must design a dashboard that identifies which communities need which interventions based on real-time data.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which data indicators signal early vs. advanced stages of an opioid crisis?
• How would you prioritize interventions when budgets are limited?
• At what point in the feedback loop is intervention most cost-effective?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What data sources would feed your dashboard?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you visualize risk levels for decision-makers?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you account for the lag between prescription changes and overdose outcomes?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you measure whether your intervention is working?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Dashboard integrates multiple data streams, stages communities, recommends interventions with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Dashboard identifies risk levels, recommends interventions with model support
• Developing (2): Dashboard shows indicators but lacks clear connection to epidemic stage
• Beginning (1): Dashboard is incomplete or disconnected from the addiction model
