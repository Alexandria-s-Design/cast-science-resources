### Title
**The Antibiotic Resistance Arms Race — How Superbugs Are Winning — And Why We Created Them**

### Overview
This lesson uses a feedback-dominant model to explore one of the most pressing threats to global health: antibiotic resistance. The core dynamic is a reinforcing feedback loop — as resistant bacteria increase in proportion, antibiotic effectiveness decreases, which allows even more resistant bacteria to survive. Unlike systems with balancing feedback that self-correct, this reinforcing loop drives exponential change, making resistance an accelerating crisis rather than a self-limiting problem. Students will explore how human behavior (dosage and duration choices) interacts with evolutionary mechanisms (mutation and natural selection) to produce outcomes that threaten modern medicine. Students investigate the driving question: Why are doctors terrified of "superbugs" — and how did WE create them? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 2: Advanced

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS4-2, HS-LS4-3**: Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how natural selection drives antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations through reinforcing feedback loops
- Explain why incomplete antibiotic courses accelerate resistance evolution
- Analyze the reinforcing feedback loop between resistant bacteria proportion and antibiotic effectiveness
- Predict how different treatment strategies affect the long-term balance between bacteria and antibiotics
- Evaluate public health policies designed to slow the emergence of superbugs

### Component List (Starting Model: 6 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Antibiotic Dosage | External | The concentration of antibiotic administered to the patient, measured relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration |
| Treatment Duration | External | How long the antibiotic course is maintained — full course (10-14 days) vs. shortened or incomplete treatment |
| Bacterial Population | Internal | Total number of bacteria in the infection, including both susceptible and resistant strains |
| Resistant Bacteria Percentage | Internal | The proportion of the bacterial population carrying resistance genes — the key variable in the reinforcing feedback loop |
| Mutation Rate | Internal | The rate at which random genetic mutations occur, some of which may confer antibiotic resistance to individual bacteria |
| Immune Response | Internal | The strength of the body's natural immune defenses working alongside antibiotics to clear the infection |

THE ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE ARMS RACE

How Superbugs Are Winning — And Why We Created Them.
Why are doctors terrified of "superbugs" — and how did WE create them?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Antibiotic Dosage" — the concentration of antibiotic administered to the patient
  ○ Click "Treatment Duration" — how long the antibiotic course is maintained — full course (10-14 days) vs
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Bacterial Population" — total number of bacteria in the infection
  ○ Click "Resistant Bacteria Percentage" — the proportion of the bacterial population carrying resistance genes — the key variable in the reinforcing feedback loop
  ○ Click "Mutation Rate" — the rate at which random genetic mutations occur
  ○ Click "Immune Response" — the strength of the body's natural immune defenses working alongside antibiotics to clear the infection

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 6 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why are doctors terrified of "superbugs" — and how did WE create them?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Antibiotic Dosage' — that's external. The concentration of antibiotic administered to the patient.
Click on 'Treatment Duration' — that's external. How long the antibiotic course is maintained — full course (10-14 days) vs.
Click on 'Bacterial Population' — that's internal. Total number of bacteria in the infection.
Click on 'Resistant Bacteria Percentage' — that's internal. The proportion of the bacterial population carrying resistance genes — the key variable in the reinforcing feedback loop.
Click on 'Mutation Rate' — that's internal. The rate at which random genetic mutations occur.
Click on 'Immune Response' — that's internal. The strength of the body's natural immune defenses working alongside antibiotics to clear the infection.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Antibiotic Dosage and Treatment Duration are external components because they are controlled by human decisions — doctors prescribe them and patients choose whether to follow through. The system doesn't determine these values; people do. Bacterial Population, Resistant Bacteria Percentage, Mutation Rate, and Immune Response are internal because they are determined by biological processes within the system. Mutation Rate is internal because while it has a baseline, it is a property of the bacterial population itself, not something externally controlled. The key insight is that the external components (human choices) drive the selective pressure that activates the internal reinforcing feedback loop.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 6 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Antibiotic Dosage" and drag an arrow to "Bacterial Population"
• Click on "Treatment Duration" and drag an arrow to "Resistant Bacteria Percentage"
• Click on "Bacterial Population" and drag an arrow to "Resistant Bacteria Percentage"
• Click on "Resistant Bacteria Percentage" and drag an arrow to "Bacterial Population"
• Click on "Mutation Rate" and drag an arrow to "Resistant Bacteria Percentage"
• Click on "Immune Response" and drag an arrow to "Bacterial Population"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Antibiotic Dosage → Bacterial Population = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher antibiotic dosage kills more susceptible bacteria, reducing the total Bacterial Population. However, this effect diminishes as Resistant Bacteria Percentage increases — a critical non-linearity in the system.

  ○ Treatment Duration → Resistant Bacteria Percentage = NEGATIVE (−)
    Longer, complete treatment courses reduce Resistant Bacteria Percentage by ensuring that even partially resistant bacteria are eliminated. Incomplete treatment leaves resistant bacteria alive and removes their susceptible competitors.

  ○ Bacterial Population → Resistant Bacteria Percentage = POSITIVE (+)
    As susceptible bacteria are killed by antibiotics, the Resistant Bacteria Percentage increases because resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition. This is the entry point to the reinforcing feedback loop.

  ○ Resistant Bacteria Percentage → Bacterial Population = POSITIVE (+)
    As resistance increases, antibiotics become less effective, allowing the total Bacterial Population to rebound — now dominated by resistant strains.

  ○ Mutation Rate → Resistant Bacteria Percentage = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher mutation rates increase the probability of resistance genes appearing in the population, feeding the reinforcing loop with new resistant individuals.

  ○ Immune Response → Bacterial Population = NEGATIVE (−)
    A strong immune response works alongside antibiotics to reduce bacterial population. When immune response is weak, antibiotics must do all the work, increasing the chance of incomplete clearance.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 6 arrows total
• 3 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When a patient stops taking antibiotics early because they feel better, which bacteria are still alive — the susceptible ones or the resistant ones? What happens to the resistant bacteria percentage, and how does that change the effectiveness of the same antibiotic next time?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Antibiotic Dosage' and drag an arrow
over to 'Bacterial Population.'

Here's the key question: When antibiotic dosage goes UP, does
bacterial population go UP or DOWN?

Higher antibiotic dosage kills more susceptible bacteria, reducing the total Bacterial Population. However, this effect diminishes as Resistant Bacteria Percentage increases — a critical non-linearity in the system.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Treatment Duration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Resistant Bacteria Percentage.'

Here's the key question: When treatment duration goes UP, does
resistant bacteria percentage go UP or DOWN?

Longer, complete treatment courses reduce Resistant Bacteria Percentage by ensuring that even partially resistant bacteria are eliminated. Incomplete treatment leaves resistant bacteria alive and removes their susceptible competitors.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Bacterial Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Resistant Bacteria Percentage.'

Here's the key question: When bacterial population goes UP, does
resistant bacteria percentage go UP or DOWN?

As susceptible bacteria are killed by antibiotics, the Resistant Bacteria Percentage increases because resistant bacteria survive and reproduce without competition. This is the entry point to the reinforcing feedback loop.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Resistant Bacteria Percentage' and drag an arrow
over to 'Bacterial Population.'

Here's the key question: When resistant bacteria percentage goes UP, does
bacterial population go UP or DOWN?

As resistance increases, antibiotics become less effective, allowing the total Bacterial Population to rebound — now dominated by resistant strains.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Mutation Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Resistant Bacteria Percentage.'

Here's the key question: When mutation rate goes UP, does
resistant bacteria percentage go UP or DOWN?

Higher mutation rates increase the probability of resistance genes appearing in the population, feeding the reinforcing loop with new resistant individuals.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Immune Response' and drag an arrow
over to 'Bacterial Population.'

Here's the key question: When immune response goes UP, does
bacterial population go UP or DOWN?

A strong immune response works alongside antibiotics to reduce bacterial population. When immune response is weak, antibiotics must do all the work, increasing the chance of incomplete clearance.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 3 negative and 3
positive relationships. 6 arrows total.

When a patient stops taking antibiotics early because they feel better, which bacteria are still alive — the susceptible ones or the resistant ones? What happens to the resistant bacteria percentage, and how does that change the effectiveness of the same antibiotic next time?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Antibiotic Dosage is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — FULL COURSE
• High dosage, full duration, normal immune response
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Resistant Bacteria Percentage when treatment is completed fully? Will it increase, decrease, or stay the same?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — INCOMPLETE COURSE
• High dosage, 50% duration, normal immune response
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Bacterial Population AFTER the patient stops treatment early? Think about which bacteria survived.
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — SUB-THERAPEUTIC DOSAGE
• Low dosage, full duration, normal immune response
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict is MORE dangerous — no antibiotic at all, or a dose that's too low? Why?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Antibiotics don't create resistant bacteria — they create the CONDITIONS for resistant bacteria to thrive by killing susceptible competitors
• Incomplete antibiotic courses are worse than no treatment at all because they selectively breed resistance
• The reinforcing feedback loop means once resistance passes a threshold, the same antibiotic becomes essentially useless
• Bacteria can share resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer, meaning one resistant species can arm others
• The mutation rate is constant, but selection pressure from antibiotics determines whether those mutations matter
• Immune response is a critical partner — antibiotics alone cannot eliminate infections if the immune system is compromised

THE ANSWER: Doctors are terrified of superbugs because WE created them through the misuse of antibiotics. Every time someone takes an incomplete course or uses antibiotics unnecessarily, they kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant ones alive. Those resistant bacteria multiply, share their resistance genes, and become a larger proportion of the population. This reinforcing feedback loop — more resistance leads to less effectiveness leads to more resistance — has produced bacteria that no existing antibiotic can kill. We are in an arms race with evolution, and right now, the bacteria are winning.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Full Course. High dosage, full duration, normal immune response.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Incomplete Course.
High dosage, 50% duration, normal immune response.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Bacterial Population AFTER the patient stops treatment early? Think about which bacteria survived.

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Sub-Therapeutic Dosage. Low dosage, full duration, normal immune response.
What do you predict is MORE dangerous — no antibiotic at all, or a dose that's too low? Why?

Here's what our model reveals: Doctors are terrified of superbugs because WE created them through the misuse of antibiotics. Every time someone takes an incomplete course or uses antibiotics unnecessarily, they kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant ones alive. Those resistant bacteria multiply, share their resistance genes, and become a larger proportion of the population. This reinforcing feedback loop — more resistance leads to less effectiveness leads to more resistance — has produced bacteria that no existing antibiotic can kill. We are in an arms race with evolution, and right now, the bacteria are winning.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Antibiotic Dosage?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Treatment Duration?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Horizontal Gene Transfer Rate — The rate at which bacteria share resistance genes with other bacteria through plasmid transfer, even between different species
   • Antibiotic Diversity — The number of different antibiotic classes available for treatment — when resistance develops to one, doctors switch to another
   • Biofilm Formation — The ability of bacteria to form protective communities on surfaces, which dramatically increases their resistance to antibiotics

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Evolution of Resistance — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Reinforcing Feedback Loop — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is the reinforcing feedback loop in antibiotic resistance so dangerous compared to a system with balancing feedback?
   • Your model shows that incomplete treatment is worse than no treatment. How would you explain this counterintuitive result to a friend?
   • How does horizontal gene transfer make the resistance problem even worse than your basic model shows?
   • What role does the immune system play in your model, and why can't we rely on antibiotics alone?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 6 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Horizontal Gene Transfer Rate. The rate at which bacteria share resistance genes with other bacteria through plasmid transfer, even between different species
How would you model that?

Antibiotic Diversity. The number of different antibiotic classes available for treatment — when resistance develops to one, doctors switch to another
How would you model that?

Biofilm Formation. The ability of bacteria to form protective communities on surfaces, which dramatically increases their resistance to antibiotics
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

Do: Preview LEVER steps. Draw the reinforcing loop on the board: more resistance → less effectiveness → more resistance. Ask: 'What makes this loop dangerous compared to a balancing loop that self-corrects?'
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: The Antibiotic Resistance Arms Race
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson uses a feedback-dominant model to explore one of the most pressing threats to global health: antibiotic resistance. The core dynamic is a reinforcing feedback loop — as resistant bacteria increase in proportion, antibiotic effectiveness decreases, which allows even more resistant bacteria to survive. Unlike systems with balancing feedback that self-correct, this reinforcing loop drives exponential change, making resistance an accelerating crisis rather than a self-limiting problem. Students will explore how human behavior (dosage and duration choices) interacts with evolutionary mechanisms (mutation and natural selection) to produce outcomes that threaten modern medicine.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS4-2, HS-LS4-3: Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model with reinforcing feedback loops to explain how natural selection drives antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations under different treatment conditions.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS4.B Natural Selection / LS4.C Adaptation
  Natural selection acts on the variation in bacterial populations, where antibiotic exposure provides selective pressure favoring resistant individuals. Adaptation occurs at the population level as resistant traits become more prevalent.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect: Mechanism and Prediction
  Students trace the causal chain from antibiotic misuse through selective pressure to resistance evolution, using their model to predict outcomes of different treatment strategies.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Antibiotic Resistance, Reinforcing Feedback Loop, Selective Pressure, Mutation Rate, Horizontal Gene Transfer, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
□ Prepare Why are doctors terrified of "superbugs" — and how did WE create them discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify six components of the antibiotic resistance system: Antibiotic Dosage and Treatment Duration as external variables (human-controlled), and Bacterial Population, Resistant Bacteria Percentage, Mutation Rate, and Immune Response as internal variables (system-determined). Students must recognize that human choices directly drive the selective pressure that feeds the reinforcing loop.
• Establish: Students map the reinforcing feedback loop: Antibiotic Dosage kills susceptible bacteria → Resistant Bacteria Percentage increases → Antibiotic effectiveness decreases → more resistant bacteria survive → Resistant Bacteria Percentage increases further. They also identify the balancing role of Immune Response and the threshold effect of Treatment Duration (completing vs. not completing the course).
• Visualize: Students build a multi-component model showing how Antibiotic Dosage and Treatment Duration interact with Bacterial Population dynamics, the reinforcing feedback loop driving Resistant Bacteria Percentage, the modulating effect of Mutation Rate, and the supporting role of Immune Response.
• Evaluate: Students run scenarios comparing full course, incomplete course, and sub-therapeutic dosage, evaluating which conditions activate the reinforcing feedback loop most dangerously. They analyze why incomplete treatment produces worse outcomes than no treatment — a counterintuitive prediction their model must explain.
• Revise: Students extend the model by adding Horizontal Gene Transfer Rate, Antibiotic Diversity, or Biofilm Formation to explore how real-world complexity accelerates or mitigates resistance evolution beyond the basic reinforcing loop.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Evolution of Resistance:
  Antibiotic resistance is evolution in real time. When Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, he warned that bacteria would evolve resistance if the drug was misused. He was right. Bacteria reproduce every 20-30 minutes, with each generation introducing random mutations. Most mutations are neutral or harmful, but occasionally one confers resistance to an antibiotic. In a normal population, these resistant bacteria have no advantage. But when antibiotics are introduced, they kill susceptible bacteria while resistant ones survive and multiply — classic natural selection. The key insight is that antibiotics don't CAUSE resistance; they CREATE THE CONDITIONS where pre-existing resistance becomes advantageous.

• The Reinforcing Feedback Loop:
  The dangerous dynamic in antibiotic resistance is a reinforcing (positive) feedback loop. As the proportion of resistant bacteria increases, the effective antibiotic concentration decreases (because fewer bacteria are susceptible). Lower effectiveness means more bacteria survive treatment, which further increases the resistant proportion. This loop accelerates over time — each cycle makes the next cycle worse. In systems thinking, this is called a 'vicious cycle' because it drives the system toward an increasingly undesirable state. The only way to break the loop is to interrupt it early, before resistance becomes dominant.

• Why Incomplete Treatment Is Worse Than None:
  This is the counterintuitive insight that makes the model powerful: taking antibiotics for only a few days is MORE dangerous than not taking them at all. With no antibiotics, resistant and susceptible bacteria coexist without selective pressure favoring either group. But a partial course kills most susceptible bacteria while leaving resistant ones alive. The resistant bacteria, now freed from competition, multiply rapidly. The patient 'feels better' because the bacterial load dropped, but the remaining population is now dominated by resistant strains. Next time, the same antibiotic may not work at all.

• The Global Crisis:
  The WHO has declared antibiotic resistance a top-10 global public health threat. In the US alone, over 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur annually, causing over 35,000 deaths. Some bacteria, like MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae), resist nearly all existing antibiotics. The pipeline for new antibiotics is nearly empty because pharmaceutical companies find antibiotics less profitable than drugs for chronic conditions. Without effective antibiotics, routine surgeries, cancer chemotherapy, and organ transplants become life-threatening procedures.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Antibiotics stop working because your body becomes immune to them"
  Reality: It's not YOUR body that becomes resistant — it's the BACTERIA. Antibiotic resistance is an evolutionary adaptation of bacterial populations, not a change in human physiology. The bacteria evolve through natural selection: those with resistance genes survive treatment and pass those genes to their offspring.
  Strategy: Ask: 'If you take the same painkiller many times, does the painkiller stop working, or does your body change?' Then flip it: 'With antibiotics, it's the bacteria that change, not you or the drug.'

• "Antibiotics create resistant bacteria"
  Reality: Antibiotics don't CREATE resistance — they CREATE THE CONDITIONS where pre-existing resistance becomes advantageous. Resistance mutations exist randomly in bacterial populations before any antibiotic exposure. Antibiotics just remove the competition, allowing those rare resistant individuals to dominate.
  Strategy: Analogy: Imagine a classroom where some students have umbrellas and others don't. Rain doesn't CREATE umbrellas — but rain makes having an umbrella a huge advantage. The umbrellas were already there.

• "Taking more antibiotics is always better"
  Reality: Higher doses and longer courses aren't always better — the optimal strategy is taking the RIGHT dose for the RIGHT duration as prescribed. Excessive antibiotic use (including in livestock agriculture) creates unnecessary selective pressure that breeds resistance without medical benefit. The goal is to use antibiotics precisely, not maximally.
  Strategy: Ask: 'If using a hammer is good for driving nails, is using a sledgehammer always better?' Precision matters more than force in both construction and medicine.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why are doctors terrified of "superbugs" — and how did WE create them?
Answer: Doctors are terrified of superbugs because WE created them through the misuse of antibiotics. Every time someone takes an incomplete course or uses antibiotics unnecessarily, they kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant ones alive. Those resistant bacteria multiply, share their resistance genes, and become a larger proportion of the population. This reinforcing feedback loop — more resistance leads to less effectiveness leads to more resistance — has produced bacteria that no existing antibiotic can kill. We are in an arms race with evolution, and right now, the bacteria are winning.

Simulation Answers:
• Full Course Scenario: When Antibiotic Dosage is high and Treatment Duration is complete, the Bacterial Population drops rapidly and stays low. Resistant Bacteria Percentage initially increases as susceptible bacteria are killed first, but with sustained treatment, even partially resistant bacteria are eliminated. The Immune Response has time to clear remaining bacteria. The reinforcing loop is activated briefly but interrupted before it can spiral.
• Incomplete Course Scenario: When Treatment Duration is cut to 50%, the initial results look similar — Bacterial Population drops and the patient feels better. However, the remaining bacteria are disproportionately resistant. Without continued antibiotic pressure, these resistant bacteria multiply rapidly. Resistant Bacteria Percentage surges to near 100%. The reinforcing loop fully activates: more resistance → less effectiveness → more resistance. If this infection is treated again, the same antibiotic will be far less effective.
• Sub-Therapeutic Dosage Scenario: Low dosage creates the WORST outcome. The antibiotic is strong enough to create selective pressure (killing some susceptible bacteria) but too weak to kill resistant ones. This is the perfect environment for evolving resistance — strong enough to select, too weak to eliminate. Resistant Bacteria Percentage climbs steadily while Bacterial Population remains high. The reinforcing loop runs continuously at a moderate rate, breeding resistance over time.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is incomplete treatment worse than no treatment?
  A: Without antibiotics, resistant and susceptible bacteria coexist in their natural proportions — there's no selective pressure favoring either group. But incomplete treatment kills most susceptible bacteria while leaving resistant ones alive. Now the resistant bacteria have no competition for resources. They multiply and become the dominant population. The next time antibiotics are used, the starting population is already heavily resistant, making the reinforcing feedback loop kick in faster and harder.
• Q: How does the reinforcing feedback loop make this an accelerating crisis?
  A: In a balancing feedback loop, the system self-corrects — more of one thing leads to less of it, stabilizing the system. But the antibiotic resistance loop is reinforcing: more resistant bacteria → less antibiotic effectiveness → more resistant bacteria survive → even less effectiveness. Each cycle amplifies the previous one. This means resistance doesn't grow linearly — it accelerates. Once the resistant proportion passes a critical threshold, the antibiotic becomes effectively useless, and the loop has 'won.'

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Public Health Antibiotic Stewardship Campaign
Mission: Using data from your simulation model, design an evidence-based public health campaign that communicates WHY antibiotic misuse creates superbugs and recommends specific behavioral changes to slow resistance evolution.
Scenario: The World Health Organization has hired your team to create a campaign targeting teenagers and young adults. You must use your model data to create compelling, scientifically accurate messaging about antibiotic resistance that changes behavior, not just awareness.
Introduction: Present the challenge: The WHO has declared antibiotic resistance a top-10 global health threat. Your team has been hired to create a public health campaign that uses your model data to change behavior around antibiotic use. You must communicate the science of reinforcing feedback loops in a way that motivates action, not just understanding.

Key Concepts:
• Reinforcing Feedback Loops: Unlike balancing loops that stabilize systems, reinforcing loops amplify change. In antibiotic resistance, the loop is: more resistant bacteria → less antibiotic effectiveness → more resistance. This means the problem accelerates over time unless the loop is interrupted.
• Selective Pressure and Natural Selection: Antibiotics create selective pressure by killing susceptible bacteria. Resistant bacteria survive not because antibiotics make them resistant, but because pre-existing mutations give them an advantage. This is natural selection in real time, observable over days rather than millennia.
• Threshold Effects in Treatment: There is a critical threshold in treatment: if enough bacteria are killed (by completing the full course), the immune system can clear the rest. If not enough are killed (incomplete course), the surviving resistant population rebounds. The threshold is the difference between cure and catastrophe.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Campaign uses specific model data to support claims, accurately explains the reinforcing feedback loop in accessible language, proposes evidence-based behavioral changes with measurable outcomes, and addresses both individual and systemic solutions
• Proficient (3): Campaign accurately represents the science of resistance, uses model data, and proposes clear behavioral recommendations
• Developing (2): Campaign shows understanding of resistance but lacks model data support or proposes vague behavioral changes
• Beginning (1): Campaign contains scientific inaccuracies or does not connect to model evidence

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a visual reinforcing feedback loop diagram that students can trace with their finger, labeling each step
  • Use a physical analogy: red and green M&Ms in a bag — 'antibiotics' remove only green ones, leaving red to dominate
  • Sentence frames: 'When [treatment variable] changes, the reinforcing loop [activates/is interrupted] because ___'
  • Scaffolded data table for recording simulation results with columns for each component over time

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research MRSA or CRE and model how horizontal gene transfer accelerates resistance spread across species
  • Investigate phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics and add it as a new component in the model
  • Analyze real-world data from the CDC's Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report and compare to model predictions
  • Model the economic incentives that discourage pharmaceutical companies from developing new antibiotics

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate exponential growth rates for resistant bacterial populations and determine the 'tipping point' where resistance becomes dominant using your model data
  • ELA: Write a persuasive op-ed for a school newspaper explaining why antibiotic misuse is everyone's problem, using evidence from your computational model
  • Social Studies: Research how antibiotic resistance disproportionately affects low-income communities and countries with less regulated pharmaceutical systems

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how natural selection drives antibiotic resistance through reinforcing feedback loops
• Explain why incomplete antibiotic treatment accelerates resistance evolution
• Predict the outcome of different treatment strategies using computational modeling
• Evaluate public health interventions based on model evidence

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A patient takes antibiotics for 3 days instead of the prescribed 10 days because they feel better. According to the reinforcing feedback loop model, what is the most likely long-term consequence?
• Constructed Response: Using your computational model, explain the reinforcing feedback loop that drives antibiotic resistance. Include in your explanation why this loop makes resistance an accelerating problem rather than a self-correcting one, and propose an evidence-based intervention to slow the loop.
