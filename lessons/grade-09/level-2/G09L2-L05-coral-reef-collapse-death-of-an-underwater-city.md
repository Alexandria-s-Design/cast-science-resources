### Title
**Coral Reef Collapse: Death of an Underwater City — Modeling Cascading Ecosystem Failure Through Coupled Feedback Loops**

### Overview
Coral reefs cover less than 1 percent of the ocean but support 25 percent of all marine species. Understanding collapse requires modeling coupled feedback between thermal stress, symbiosis, trophic interactions, and ocean chemistry. Students investigate the driving question: How can a 1 degree C temperature change destroy an ecosystem that took 10,000 years to build? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

CORAL REEF COLLAPSE: DEATH OF AN UNDERWATER CITY

Modeling Cascading Ecosystem Failure Through Coupled Feedback Loops.
How can a 1 degree C temperature change destroy an ecosystem that took 10,000 years to build?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Ocean Temperature" — sea surface temperature in the reef zone
  ○ Click "Water Acidity" — ocean ph level
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Coral Bleaching Rate" — percentage of coral colonies expelling zooxanthellae per unit time
  ○ Click "Algae Overgrowth" — rate at which macroalgae colonize dead or weakened coral surfaces
  ○ Click "Fish Population" — abundance of herbivorous fish that graze algae and keep it from smothering coral
  ○ Click "Symbiotic Zooxanthellae" — density of photosynthetic symbionts within coral tissue providing energy
  ○ Click "Reef Structural Integrity" — physical framework strength providing habitat and coastal buffering

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 7 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How can a 1 degree C temperature change destroy an ecosystem that took 10,000 years to build?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Ocean Temperature' — that's external. Sea surface temperature in the reef zone.
Click on 'Coral Bleaching Rate' — that's internal. Percentage of coral colonies expelling zooxanthellae per unit time.
Click on 'Algae Overgrowth' — that's internal. Rate at which macroalgae colonize dead or weakened coral surfaces.
Click on 'Fish Population' — that's internal. Abundance of herbivorous fish that graze algae and keep it from smothering coral.
Click on 'Water Acidity' — that's external. Ocean pH level.
Click on 'Symbiotic Zooxanthellae' — that's internal. Density of photosynthetic symbionts within coral tissue providing energy.
Click on 'Reef Structural Integrity' — that's internal. Physical framework strength providing habitat and coastal buffering.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Ocean Temperature and Water Acidity are external inputs driven by human carbon emissions. Bleaching Rate, Algae Overgrowth, Fish Population, Zooxanthellae, and Structural Integrity are internal ecological responses.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 7 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Ocean Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Bleaching Rate"
• Click on "Bleaching Rate" and drag an arrow to "Zooxanthellae"
• Click on "Zooxanthellae" and drag an arrow to "Structural Integrity"
• Click on "Structural Integrity" and drag an arrow to "Fish Population"
• Click on "Fish Population" and drag an arrow to "Algae Overgrowth"
• Click on "Algae Overgrowth" and drag an arrow to "Bleaching Rate"
• Click on "Water Acidity" and drag an arrow to "Structural Integrity"
• Click on "Water Acidity" and drag an arrow to "Bleaching Rate"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Ocean Temperature → Bleaching Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher temperatures trigger thermal stress and bleaching.

  ○ Bleaching Rate → Zooxanthellae = NEGATIVE (−)
    Bleaching expels zooxanthellae from coral tissue.

  ○ Zooxanthellae → Structural Integrity = POSITIVE (+)
    Healthy symbionts provide energy for coral growth and skeleton maintenance.

  ○ Structural Integrity → Fish Population = POSITIVE (+)
    Reef structure provides habitat for herbivorous fish.

  ○ Fish Population → Algae Overgrowth = NEGATIVE (−)
    Herbivorous fish graze algae, preventing smothering.

  ○ Algae Overgrowth → Bleaching Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Algae smother coral, adding stress that accelerates death.

  ○ Water Acidity → Structural Integrity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Acidification weakens coral skeletons.

  ○ Water Acidity → Bleaching Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Acidification lowers the temperature threshold for bleaching.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 8 arrows total
• 3 negative relationship(s), 5 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Ocean Temperature rises and Coral Bleaching increases, what happens to Zooxanthellae? Without them, what happens to coral energy? If coral dies, where do fish go? Without fish, what happens to algae?

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Ocean Temperature is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — MILD WARMING
• Temperature +0.5 C for one season
• PREDICT FIRST: Can coral recover if temperature returns to normal?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — SUSTAINED WARMING
• Temperature +1.5 C maintained
• PREDICT FIRST: At what point does bleaching become irreversible?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — TRIPLE THREAT
• Temperature +1 C, acidity +0.1 pH, high fishing
• PREDICT FIRST: Are 3 small problems worse than 1 big one?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Coral bleaching creates a cascading feedback loop from heat through starvation to permanent phase shift
• There is a temperature threshold beyond which bleaching accelerates faster than recovery
• Multiple moderate stressors can trigger collapse when no single stressor alone would be sufficient
• The phase shift to algae dominance represents a stable alternative state that persists even after stress removal

THE ANSWER: A 1 degree change triggers cascading coupled feedback loops. Thermal stress causes coral to expel zooxanthellae. Without photosynthetic partners, coral loses 90 percent of its energy and dies. Dead surfaces are colonized by algae. As reef structure degrades, herbivorous fish lose habitat. Without fish, algae smother remaining coral. The system reaches a phase shift -- a new algae-dominated state that is self-reinforcing even if temperatures normalize.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Mild Warming. Temperature +0.5 C for one season.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Sustained Warming.
Temperature +1.5 C maintained.

Before you run it — make a prediction. At what point does bleaching become irreversible?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Triple Threat. Temperature +1 C, acidity +0.1 pH, high fishing.
Are 3 small problems worse than 1 big one?

Here's what our model reveals: A 1 degree change triggers cascading coupled feedback loops. Thermal stress causes coral to expel zooxanthellae. Without photosynthetic partners, coral loses 90 percent of its energy and dies. Dead surfaces are colonized by algae. As reef structure degrades, herbivorous fish lose habitat. Without fish, algae smother remaining coral. The system reaches a phase shift -- a new algae-dominated state that is self-reinforcing even if temperatures normalize.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Ocean Temperature?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Water Acidity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Coral Recruitment Rate — Rate at which new coral larvae settle and grow, determining reef regeneration ability
   • Sedimentation Rate — Amount of sediment from coastal development that smothers coral and blocks light
   • Marine Protected Area Coverage — Percentage of reef protected from fishing and development

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Coral-Zooxanthellae Symbiosis — how does this connect to your model?
   • Thermal Stress Thresholds — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model demonstrate that reef collapse is a cascading system failure?
   • Why is the phase shift so difficult to reverse even if temperatures stabilize?
   • How do multiple moderate stressors interact differently than a single severe stressor?
   • What does your model suggest about conservation vs. restoration?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 7 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Coral Recruitment Rate. Rate at which new coral larvae settle and grow, determining reef regeneration ability
How would you model that?

Sedimentation Rate. Amount of sediment from coastal development that smothers coral and blocks light
How would you model that?

Marine Protected Area Coverage. Percentage of reef protected from fishing and development
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

TEACHER GUIDE: Coral Reef Collapse: Death of an Underwater City
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Coral reefs cover less than 1 percent of the ocean but support 25 percent of all marine species. Understanding collapse requires modeling coupled feedback between thermal stress, symbiosis, trophic interactions, and ocean chemistry.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS2-6, HS-ESS3-3: Evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms. Create a computational simulation of a natural system.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
  Students use computational models to simulate threshold dynamics and phase shifts in a coupled ecosystem.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
  Coral reef stability depends on mutualistic relationships, trophic cascades, and structural integrity that can fail catastrophically.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students model how stable ecosystems undergo rapid irreversible phase shifts when feedback loops push past tipping points.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Coral Bleaching, Zooxanthellae, Phase Shift, Biogeochemical Coupling
□ Prepare How can a 1 degree C temperature change destroy an ecosystem that took 10,000 years to build discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify the 7 interacting reef system components.
• Establish: Students map cascading feedback loops through thermal, chemical, and biological pathways.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how coupled stressors cascade to produce phase shift.
• Evaluate: Students run mild, sustained, and combined-stressor scenarios to identify thresholds.
• Revise: Students add coral recruitment, sedimentation, or marine protection to explore intervention strategies.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Coral-Zooxanthellae Symbiosis:
  Zooxanthellae provide up to 90 percent of coral energy through photosynthesis. When thermal stress disrupts the partnership, the coral loses its energy source AND its color.

• Thermal Stress Thresholds:
  A rise of just 1 C above summer peak for 4+ weeks triggers bleaching. If brief, recovery occurs in 6-12 months. If prolonged, coral starves and dies.

• The Phase Shift Cascade:
  Dead coral is colonized by algae. If algae outpaces fish grazing, it smothers remaining coral and prevents larvae settlement, creating a self-reinforcing algae state.

• Ocean Acidification Coupling:
  CO2 acidifies ocean water, weakening coral skeletons AND lowering the temperature threshold for bleaching. The two stressors are multiplicative.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Bleaching means coral is dead"
  Reality: Bleaching is stress, not death. Coral is alive but starving. If stress is removed within weeks, zooxanthellae recolonize. Death occurs with prolonged bleaching.
  Strategy: Timeline: Healthy > Bleached (alive, recoverable) > Dead (irreversible). At which stage can we still intervene?

• "If we stop warming reefs will recover"
  Reality: Stopping warming is necessary but not sufficient after a phase shift. Algae maintain dominance through their own feedback loops. Recovery requires active multi-component intervention.
  Strategy: If a house burns down and you put out the fire, do you have a house? Stopping warming is putting out the fire. Restoration is rebuilding.

• "Reefs will migrate to cooler water"
  Reality: Reef migration is not feasible. Reefs need specific conditions and centuries to build structure. Warming rates are 50-100x faster than natural migration.
  Strategy: Can you move a 500-year-old forest? Reefs face the same timescale problem.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How can a 1 degree C temperature change destroy an ecosystem that took 10,000 years to build?
Answer: A 1 degree change triggers cascading coupled feedback loops. Thermal stress causes coral to expel zooxanthellae. Without photosynthetic partners, coral loses 90 percent of its energy and dies. Dead surfaces are colonized by algae. As reef structure degrades, herbivorous fish lose habitat. Without fish, algae smother remaining coral. The system reaches a phase shift -- a new algae-dominated state that is self-reinforcing even if temperatures normalize.

Simulation Answers:
• Mild Warming: A 0.5 C increase causes mild bleaching. When temperature normalizes, zooxanthellae recolonize over 6-12 months. The system demonstrates resilience and returns to coral-dominated state.
• Combined Stressors: Temperature, acidity, and fishing each lower thresholds for the others. The cascade accelerates dramatically. The reef crosses phase-shift threshold in half the time of temperature alone. 1+1+1 is greater than 3.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is the phase shift hard to reverse?
  A: Algae create self-reinforcing conditions. They smother coral larvae, preventing settlement. Without coral, reef erodes, losing fish habitat. Without fish, algae grow unchecked. Even if temperature normalizes, the algae state persists.
• Q: How do stressors interact?
  A: Stressors interact multiplicatively. Acidification lowers the bleaching threshold. Overfishing removes algae control. Three moderate stressors together can push the system past its tipping point when none alone would.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Reef Resilience Monitoring System
Mission: Design a monitoring system that detects early warnings of reef collapse and triggers interventions before the phase shift becomes irreversible.
Scenario: The Great Barrier Reef has experienced three mass bleaching events in five years. Design an early-warning system that predicts which reef sections are approaching the tipping point.
Introduction: The Great Barrier Reef needs an early-warning and intervention system after three mass bleaching events in five years.

Key Concepts:
• Remote Sensing: Satellite thermal imaging detects temperature anomalies. Underwater sensors measure pH and dissolved oxygen. AI assesses coral cover.
• Tipping Point Indicators: Early warnings include stress markers, declining herbivore abundance, and increasing algae colonization.
• Intervention Triage: Not all sections can be saved. Triage prioritizes sections not yet past the tipping point with high biodiversity value.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): System integrates multiple technologies, uses model-derived indicators, implements triage framework, and includes effectiveness measures
• Proficient (3): System monitors key indicators, identifies at-risk sections, recommends appropriate interventions
• Developing (2): System monitors some indicators but does not clearly distinguish recoverable from shifted sections
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or disconnected from the reef model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn cascade diagram showing thermal and chemical pathways converging
  • Jenga tower analogy: each stressor removes a block until critical threshold
  • Sentence frames: When stressor increases, component responds by __, triggering __ in the next component

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research coral assisted evolution -- breeding heat-tolerant strains -- and model how this changes the temperature threshold
  • Investigate bright spots -- reefs healthy despite stressors -- and analyze what explains their resilience
  • Model the economic cascade: reef collapse to tourism loss to coastal erosion to property damage

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate compound stressor effects: if temperature causes 20 percent bleaching and acidity causes 15 percent alone but 50 percent together, what is the interaction coefficient?
  • ELA: Write a scientific policy brief arguing for emergency reef protection funding using model evidence.
  • Social Studies: Research how Indigenous Australian communities managed reef resources for 60,000 years and compare to modern management.

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model cascading feedback loops from thermal stress through bleaching to ecosystem phase shift
• Analyze how coupled stressors interact to lower the collapse threshold
• Evaluate intervention strategies targeting different components and stages

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Which scenario is MOST likely to cause irreversible phase shift: (a) single +2 C event, (b) three +1 C events with moderate overfishing, (c) moderate acidification alone, (d) heavy fishing alone?
• Constructed Response: Explain why restoring a phase-shifted reef requires interventions on MULTIPLE components simultaneously.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Reef Resilience Monitoring System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a monitoring system that detects early warnings of reef collapse and triggers interventions before the phase shift becomes irreversible.

SCENARIO: The Great Barrier Reef has experienced three mass bleaching events in five years. Design an early-warning system that predicts which reef sections are approaching the tipping point.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What indicators serve as earliest warnings of approaching phase shift?
• How would you distinguish a recoverable reef from one past the tipping point?
• Which interventions are most effective at which stages of decline?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What sensors and monitoring technologies would you deploy?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you build a predictive model for at-risk reef sections?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you triage interventions across hundreds of sections?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you validate your interventions are preventing phase shifts?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): System integrates multiple technologies, uses model-derived indicators, implements triage framework, and includes effectiveness measures
• Proficient (3): System monitors key indicators, identifies at-risk sections, recommends appropriate interventions
• Developing (2): System monitors some indicators but does not clearly distinguish recoverable from shifted sections
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or disconnected from the reef model
