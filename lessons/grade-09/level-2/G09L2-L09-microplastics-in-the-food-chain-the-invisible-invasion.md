### Title
**Microplastics in the Food Chain: The Invisible Invasion — Modeling Bioaccumulation and Trophic Transfer of Persistent Pollutants**

### Overview
An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans every year. This plastic does not decompose -- it breaks into smaller and smaller pieces that enter food chains and accumulate in organisms, including humans. Students investigate the driving question: How does a plastic bag thrown away in Kansas end up inside a fish you eat in California? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

MICROPLASTICS IN THE FOOD CHAIN: THE INVISIBLE INVASION

Modeling Bioaccumulation and Trophic Transfer of Persistent Pollutants.
How does a plastic bag thrown away in Kansas end up inside a fish you eat in California?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Plastic Input Rate" — the volume of plastic entering the environment from waste
  ○ Click "Decomposition Rate" — the extremely slow rate at which plastics break down
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Microplastic Concentration" — the density of microplastic particles in water
  ○ Click "Bioaccumulation Factor" — the ratio of microplastic concentration in an organism relative to its environment
  ○ Click "Trophic Transfer" — the efficiency with which microplastics are passed from prey organisms to predators
  ○ Click "Marine Organism Health" — the overall fitness and survival rate of organisms exposed to microplastic ingestion
  ○ Click "Human Exposure Level" — the amount of microplastics consumed by humans through seafood

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 7 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How does a plastic bag thrown away in Kansas end up inside a fish you eat in California?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Plastic Input Rate' — that's external. The volume of plastic entering the environment from waste.
Click on 'Microplastic Concentration' — that's internal. The density of microplastic particles in water.
Click on 'Bioaccumulation Factor' — that's internal. The ratio of microplastic concentration in an organism relative to its environment.
Click on 'Trophic Transfer' — that's internal. The efficiency with which microplastics are passed from prey organisms to predators.
Click on 'Marine Organism Health' — that's internal. The overall fitness and survival rate of organisms exposed to microplastic ingestion.
Click on 'Decomposition Rate' — that's external. The extremely slow rate at which plastics break down.
Click on 'Human Exposure Level' — that's internal. The amount of microplastics consumed by humans through seafood.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Plastic Input Rate and Decomposition Rate are external because input can be controlled by policy and decomposition is a material property of plastic. Microplastic Concentration, Bioaccumulation, Trophic Transfer, Organism Health, and Human Exposure are internal ecosystem responses.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 7 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Plastic Input Rate" and drag an arrow to "Microplastic Concentration"
• Click on "Decomposition Rate" and drag an arrow to "Microplastic Concentration"
• Click on "Microplastic Concentration" and drag an arrow to "Bioaccumulation Factor"
• Click on "Bioaccumulation" and drag an arrow to "Trophic Transfer"
• Click on "Trophic Transfer" and drag an arrow to "Human Exposure"
• Click on "Bioaccumulation" and drag an arrow to "Marine Organism Health"
• Click on "Marine Organism Health" and drag an arrow to "Trophic Transfer"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Plastic Input Rate → Microplastic Concentration = POSITIVE (+)
    More plastic entering the environment increases the concentration of microplastic particles.

  ○ Decomposition Rate → Microplastic Concentration = NEGATIVE (−)
    Faster decomposition would reduce concentration, but plastic decomposition is effectively zero.

  ○ Microplastic Concentration → Bioaccumulation Factor = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher environmental concentration leads to more ingestion and accumulation in organisms.

  ○ Bioaccumulation → Trophic Transfer = POSITIVE (+)
    More accumulated plastic in prey means more transferred to predators.

  ○ Trophic Transfer → Human Exposure = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher trophic transfer concentrates more plastic in seafood consumed by humans.

  ○ Bioaccumulation → Marine Organism Health = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher plastic loads cause inflammation, organ damage, and reduced fitness.

  ○ Marine Organism Health → Trophic Transfer = NEGATIVE (−)
    If organisms die from contamination, fewer are available as prey, potentially reducing but not eliminating transfer.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 7 arrows total
• 3 negative relationship(s), 4 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If Plastic Input Rate stays high and Decomposition Rate is near zero, what happens to Microplastic Concentration over decades? How does Bioaccumulation amplify this at each trophic level? What does this mean for human exposure?
```

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Plastic Input Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Microplastic Concentration.'

Here's the key question: When plastic input rate goes UP, does
microplastic concentration go UP or DOWN?

More plastic entering the environment increases the concentration of microplastic particles.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Decomposition Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Microplastic Concentration.'

Here's the key question: When decomposition rate goes UP, does
microplastic concentration go UP or DOWN?

Faster decomposition would reduce concentration, but plastic decomposition is effectively zero.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Microplastic Concentration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Bioaccumulation Factor.'

Here's the key question: When microplastic concentration goes UP, does
bioaccumulation factor go UP or DOWN?

Higher environmental concentration leads to more ingestion and accumulation in organisms.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Bioaccumulation' and drag an arrow
over to 'Trophic Transfer.'

Here's the key question: When bioaccumulation goes UP, does
trophic transfer go UP or DOWN?

More accumulated plastic in prey means more transferred to predators.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Trophic Transfer' and drag an arrow
over to 'Human Exposure.'

Here's the key question: When trophic transfer goes UP, does
human exposure go UP or DOWN?

Higher trophic transfer concentrates more plastic in seafood consumed by humans.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Bioaccumulation' and drag an arrow
over to 'Marine Organism Health.'

Here's the key question: When bioaccumulation goes UP, does
marine organism health go UP or DOWN?

Higher plastic loads cause inflammation, organ damage, and reduced fitness.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Marine Organism Health' and drag an arrow
over to 'Trophic Transfer.'

Here's the key question: When marine organism health goes UP, does
trophic transfer go UP or DOWN?

If organisms die from contamination, fewer are available as prey, potentially reducing but not eliminating transfer.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 3 negative and 4
positive relationships. 7 arrows total.

If Plastic Input Rate stays high and Decomposition Rate is near zero, what happens to Microplastic Concentration over decades? How does Bioaccumulation amplify this at each trophic level? What does this mean for human exposure?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Plastic Input Rate is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — CURRENT TRAJECTORY
• Current input, zero decomposition, 50 years
• PREDICT FIRST: How much does ocean microplastic concentration increase over 50 years?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — 50 PERCENT REDUCTION
• Half current input, existing stock persists
• PREDICT FIRST: If we cut plastic input in half today, how long until ocean concentrations drop?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — TROPHIC CASCADE
• Track concentration through 4 trophic levels
• PREDICT FIRST: How much more microplastic does a tuna have compared to the water it swims in?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Microplastic concentration in the environment is essentially a one-way ratchet because decomposition is negligible compared to input
• Bioaccumulation amplifies concentration by 10-100x at each trophic level, meaning top predators carry enormously higher loads
• Reducing plastic input slows but does not reverse the problem because existing plastics persist for centuries
• Human exposure is significant and growing -- the average person ingests a credit card worth of plastic per week

THE ANSWER: A plastic bag degrades into microplastics that enter waterways, flow to the ocean, and are ingested by plankton. Small fish eat thousands of plankton, concentrating the plastic. Larger fish eat hundreds of small fish, amplifying further. A tuna at the top of the chain carries millions of times more microplastic than the water around it. When you eat that tuna, you inherit the accumulated plastic from the entire food chain below it. Because plastic does not decompose, this is a one-way accumulation that only gets worse.
```

### Video Script

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Current Trajectory. Current input, zero decomposition, 50 years.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: 50 Percent Reduction.
Half current input, existing stock persists.

Before you run it — make a prediction. If we cut plastic input in half today, how long until ocean concentrations drop?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Trophic Cascade. Track concentration through 4 trophic levels.
How much more microplastic does a tuna have compared to the water it swims in?

Here's what our model reveals: A plastic bag degrades into microplastics that enter waterways, flow to the ocean, and are ingested by plankton. Small fish eat thousands of plankton, concentrating the plastic. Larger fish eat hundreds of small fish, amplifying further. A tuna at the top of the chain carries millions of times more microplastic than the water around it. When you eat that tuna, you inherit the accumulated plastic from the entire food chain below it. Because plastic does not decompose, this is a one-way accumulation that only gets worse.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Plastic Input Rate?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Decomposition Rate?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Chemical Leaching — Rate at which toxic additives like phthalates and BPA leach from plastic particles into organism tissue
   • Wastewater Treatment Efficiency — Percentage of microplastics removed during municipal water treatment before discharge
   • Bioremediation Potential — The capacity of engineered organisms or enzymes to break down microplastics in the environment

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Sources of Microplastics — how does this connect to your model?
   • Bioaccumulation Mechanics — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is microplastic accumulation essentially a one-way ratchet in your model?
   • How does biomagnification create a disproportionate burden on top predators and humans?
   • Why does reducing plastic input today not immediately solve the contamination problem?
   • What are the limitations of modeling microplastic fate with only 7 components?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 7 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Chemical Leaching. Rate at which toxic additives like phthalates and BPA leach from plastic particles into organism tissue
How would you model that?

Wastewater Treatment Efficiency. Percentage of microplastics removed during municipal water treatment before discharge
How would you model that?

Bioremediation Potential. The capacity of engineered organisms or enzymes to break down microplastics in the environment
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add

TEACHER GUIDE: Microplastics in the Food Chain: The Invisible Invasion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the oceans every year. This plastic does not decompose -- it breaks into smaller and smaller pieces that enter food chains and accumulate in organisms, including humans.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS2-6, HS-ESS3-3: Evaluate claims that complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent conditions. Create a computational simulation of a natural system.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Analyzing and Interpreting Data
  Students analyze how microplastic concentrations change across trophic levels and over time to identify patterns of bioaccumulation.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS2.B Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer
  Matter cycles through ecosystems, but persistent pollutants like microplastics accumulate rather than cycle, concentrating at higher trophic levels.
• Crosscutting Concept: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
  Students model how small-scale plastic inputs create large-scale concentration effects through biomagnification across trophic levels.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Microplastics, Bioaccumulation, Trophic Transfer, Biomagnification
□ Prepare How does a plastic bag thrown away in Kansas end up inside a fish you eat in California discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify plastic input, microplastic concentration, bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, organism health, decomposition rate, and human exposure as system components.
• Establish: Students map the one-way accumulation pathway from input through trophic levels to human exposure, identifying amplification at each step.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how bioaccumulation and biomagnification create disproportionate contamination at higher trophic levels.
• Evaluate: Students run current trajectory, reduction, and trophic amplification scenarios to understand timescales and intervention effectiveness.
• Revise: Students add chemical leaching, wastewater treatment, or bioremediation to explore additional intervention strategies.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Sources of Microplastics:
  Microplastics come from degradation of larger plastic waste, synthetic clothing fibers released in laundry, microbeads in personal care products, and tire wear. A single wash of synthetic clothing releases 700,000 microfibers.

• Bioaccumulation Mechanics:
  Organisms ingest microplastics by mistaking them for food or passively filtering contaminated water. Because plastic cannot be digested or excreted efficiently, it accumulates in tissues over the organism lifetime.

• Trophic Amplification:
  A small fish eats thousands of contaminated plankton. A larger fish eats hundreds of small fish. At each level, the predator inherits the accumulated plastic of all its prey. By the time you reach a top predator, concentrations can be millions of times higher than in the water.

• Human Health Implications:
  The average person ingests approximately 5 grams of plastic per week -- roughly the weight of a credit card. Microplastics have been found in human blood, lungs, and placenta. Health effects are still being studied but include inflammation, endocrine disruption, and cellular damage.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "The ocean is so big that plastic gets diluted to harmless levels"
  Reality: The ocean is large but plastic does not dilute -- it concentrates. Bioaccumulation means organisms collect and concentrate plastic from the water. Biomagnification means each trophic level amplifies further. A tuna contains millions of times more microplastic per gram than the ocean water it swims in.
  Strategy: If you drink a glass of water with 1 particle per liter, that seems harmless. Now eat a fish that drank 10,000 liters. You just ingested 10,000 particles in one meal.

• "Recycling solves the plastic problem"
  Reality: Only 9 percent of all plastic ever made has been recycled. Most plastic is used once and discarded. Recycling slows input but does not address the 5+ billion metric tons already in the environment. And recycled plastic still eventually becomes microplastic.
  Strategy: Ask: If 91 percent of your homework went in the trash, would you call your system working?

• "Microplastics are too small to cause harm"
  Reality: Microplastics carry toxic additives like phthalates and BPA that leach into tissue. They cause physical inflammation when lodged in organs. They have been found in human blood, lungs, liver, and placenta. The health effects of chronic low-level exposure are still being studied, but early evidence suggests inflammation, endocrine disruption, and cellular damage.
  Strategy: Would you eat a credit card? You already are -- approximately 5 grams per week.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does a plastic bag thrown away in Kansas end up inside a fish you eat in California?
Answer: A plastic bag degrades into microplastics that enter waterways, flow to the ocean, and are ingested by plankton. Small fish eat thousands of plankton, concentrating the plastic. Larger fish eat hundreds of small fish, amplifying further. A tuna at the top of the chain carries millions of times more microplastic than the water around it. When you eat that tuna, you inherit the accumulated plastic from the entire food chain below it. Because plastic does not decompose, this is a one-way accumulation that only gets worse.

Simulation Answers:
• Current Trajectory: With continued input and zero decomposition, ocean microplastic concentration roughly doubles every 15-20 years. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification mean top predator contamination increases even faster. Human exposure through seafood grows proportionally.
• 50 Percent Reduction: Cutting plastic input by half slows the accumulation rate but does NOT reduce existing concentrations. Because decomposition is negligible, the ocean is essentially a one-way sink. Concentrations continue to rise, just more slowly. Meaningful reduction in seafood contamination would take decades to centuries.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is this a one-way ratchet?
  A: The model shows that microplastic concentration can only increase over time because input is substantial while decomposition is negligible. Even reducing input to zero would not reduce existing concentrations. The only pathway for removal is physical extraction, which is impractical at ocean scale. This is fundamentally different from biodegradable pollutants that cycle through the system.
• Q: How does biomagnification work?
  A: At each trophic level, an organism consumes many individuals from the level below. A fish eats thousands of contaminated plankton, inheriting the accumulated plastic from all of them. A tuna eats hundreds of fish. The concentration amplifies at each step because plastic is ingested but not excreted. By the top of the food chain, concentrations are millions of times higher than in the water.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Microplastic Monitoring and Reduction System
Mission: Design a system that monitors microplastic levels across the food chain and identifies the most cost-effective intervention points.
Scenario: A coastal city's seafood industry is threatened by rising microplastic contamination. Design a monitoring system that tracks plastic from source to plate and a reduction strategy targeting the highest-impact intervention points.
Introduction: A coastal city's seafood industry faces microplastic contamination threats. Students design monitoring systems and reduction strategies targeting the highest-impact intervention points.

Key Concepts:
• Multi-Level Monitoring: Tracking microplastic concentrations at multiple trophic levels reveals where amplification is greatest and where intervention would be most effective.
• Source Reduction vs. Environmental Cleanup: Preventing plastic from entering the environment is orders of magnitude more cost-effective than removing it from the ocean.
• Timescale Mismatch: Policy changes today will not produce measurable seafood contamination reductions for decades due to the persistence of existing plastic. Expectations must be set accordingly.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): System monitors multiple trophic levels, identifies highest-impact intervention points, addresses the persistence timescale, and communicates risk responsibly
• Proficient (3): System monitors contamination levels, recommends source-reduction strategies, and uses model evidence
• Developing (2): System monitors some contamination but does not address the timescale problem or trophic amplification
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or does not connect monitoring to the food chain accumulation model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn food chain diagram with concentration increasing at each level shown numerically
  • Use a savings account analogy: if you deposit money daily and never withdraw, the balance only goes up. Plastic in the ocean works the same way.
  • Sentence frames: At trophic level __, concentration is __ times higher than level __ because each predator consumes __ prey organisms

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research plastic-eating enzymes like PETase and model how introducing bioremediation would change the Decomposition Rate component
  • Calculate the total mass of microplastic in the ocean using current concentration data and ocean volume, then project 50 years forward
  • Compare microplastic biomagnification to DDT biomagnification in the 1960s and analyze why we did not learn from history

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate biomagnification factors: if plankton has 1 particle per gram, small fish has 100 per gram, and tuna has 10,000 per gram, what is the transfer efficiency at each trophic level?
  • ELA: Write a consumer guide explaining microplastic risks in seafood, balancing scientific accuracy with accessible communication.
  • Social Studies: Research the global plastic waste trade and analyze why developing nations disproportionately bear the burden of plastic pollution from wealthy nations.

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how microplastics bioaccumulate through food chains via trophic transfer
• Analyze why persistent pollutants create one-way accumulation problems
• Evaluate monitoring and intervention strategies at different points in the plastic pathway

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Which strategy would MOST reduce human microplastic exposure from seafood: (a) ocean cleanup, (b) reducing new plastic production, (c) cooking fish differently, (d) eating farmed fish?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain why a 50 percent reduction in plastic input today would take decades to produce a measurable reduction in seafood microplastic levels.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Microplastic Monitoring and Reduction System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a system that monitors microplastic levels across the food chain and identifies the most cost-effective intervention points.

SCENARIO: A coastal city's seafood industry is threatened by rising microplastic contamination. Design a monitoring system that tracks plastic from source to plate and a reduction strategy targeting the highest-impact intervention points.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Where in the plastic pathway is intervention most effective -- at the source or in the environment?
• How would you monitor microplastic levels at different trophic levels?
• What is the lag time between reducing plastic input and seeing lower levels in seafood?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What monitoring technologies would you deploy at each stage of the food chain?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you prioritize between preventing new plastic input vs. removing existing microplastics?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you communicate risk to consumers without destroying the fishing industry?

  _________________________________________________________

• What data would prove your intervention is working given the decades-long timescale?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): System monitors multiple trophic levels, identifies highest-impact intervention points, addresses the persistence timescale, and communicates risk responsibly
• Proficient (3): System monitors contamination levels, recommends source-reduction strategies, and uses model evidence
• Developing (2): System monitors some contamination but does not address the timescale problem or trophic amplification
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or does not connect monitoring to the food chain accumulation model
