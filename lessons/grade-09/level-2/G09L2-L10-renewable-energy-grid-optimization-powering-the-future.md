### Title
**Renewable Energy Grid Optimization: Powering the Future — Modeling the Complex Challenge of a 100 Percent Clean Energy Grid**

### Overview
The clean energy transition is the defining engineering challenge of our generation. While renewable energy costs have plummeted, the fundamental challenge of intermittency remains: the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow, and society demands electricity 24/7. Students investigate the driving question: Why can't we just replace all fossil fuel power plants with solar panels and wind turbines tomorrow? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

RENEWABLE ENERGY GRID OPTIMIZATION: POWERING THE FUTURE

Modeling the Complex Challenge of a 100 Percent Clean Energy Grid.
Why can't we just replace all fossil fuel power plants with solar panels and wind turbines tomorrow?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Grid Demand" — total electricity consumption by residential
  ○ Click "Fossil Fuel Backup" — natural gas or other dispatchable generation used to fill gaps when renewables and storage cannot meet demand
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Solar Output" — electricity generated from photovoltaic panels
  ○ Click "Wind Output" — electricity generated from wind turbines
  ○ Click "Battery Storage" — energy stored in lithium-ion or other battery systems that can be charged when supply exceeds demand
  ○ Click "Transmission Efficiency" — the percentage of generated electricity that reaches consumers after transmission and distribution losses
  ○ Click "Cost per kWh" — the total cost of electricity including generation
  ○ Click "Carbon Emissions" — total co2 and equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 8 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why can't we just replace all fossil fuel power plants with solar panels and wind turbines tomorrow?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Solar Output' — that's internal. Electricity generated from photovoltaic panels.
Click on 'Wind Output' — that's internal. Electricity generated from wind turbines.
Click on 'Battery Storage' — that's internal. Energy stored in lithium-ion or other battery systems that can be charged when supply exceeds demand.
Click on 'Grid Demand' — that's external. Total electricity consumption by residential.
Click on 'Fossil Fuel Backup' — that's external. Natural gas or other dispatchable generation used to fill gaps when renewables and storage cannot meet demand.
Click on 'Transmission Efficiency' — that's internal. The percentage of generated electricity that reaches consumers after transmission and distribution losses.
Click on 'Cost per kWh' — that's internal. The total cost of electricity including generation.
Click on 'Carbon Emissions' — that's internal. Total CO2 and equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Grid Demand and Fossil Fuel Backup are external because demand is set by consumers and backup is a policy choice. Solar Output, Wind Output, Battery Storage, Transmission Efficiency, Cost per kWh, and Carbon Emissions are internal system responses determined by the energy mix and physics.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 8 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Solar Output" and drag an arrow to "Battery Storage"
• Click on "Wind Output" and drag an arrow to "Battery Storage"
• Click on "Grid Demand" and drag an arrow to "Battery Storage"
• Click on "Battery Storage" and drag an arrow to "Fossil Fuel Backup"
• Click on "Fossil Fuel Backup" and drag an arrow to "Carbon Emissions"
• Click on "Fossil Fuel Backup" and drag an arrow to "Cost per kWh"
• Click on "Battery Storage" and drag an arrow to "Cost per kWh"
• Click on "Transmission Efficiency" and drag an arrow to "Cost per kWh"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Solar Output → Battery Storage = POSITIVE (+)
    Excess solar output beyond demand charges batteries.

  ○ Wind Output → Battery Storage = POSITIVE (+)
    Excess wind output charges batteries.

  ○ Grid Demand → Battery Storage = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher demand depletes battery reserves faster.

  ○ Battery Storage → Fossil Fuel Backup = NEGATIVE (−)
    More available storage reduces the need for fossil backup.

  ○ Fossil Fuel Backup → Carbon Emissions = POSITIVE (+)
    More fossil fuel use directly increases carbon emissions.

  ○ Fossil Fuel Backup → Cost per kWh = POSITIVE (+)
    Fossil fuel operation adds fuel costs to the electricity price.

  ○ Battery Storage → Cost per kWh = POSITIVE (+)
    Storage infrastructure is expensive, raising overall cost.

  ○ Transmission Efficiency → Cost per kWh = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher efficiency reduces waste and lowers per-unit cost.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 8 arrows total
• 3 negative relationship(s), 5 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Solar Output drops to zero at night and Wind Output is calm, how does Grid Demand get met? What happens to Cost per kWh when Battery Storage runs out and Fossil Fuel Backup kicks in? How do you minimize Carbon Emissions while keeping the lights on?

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Grid Demand is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — SUNNY WINDY DAY
• Peak solar, strong wind, moderate demand
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to battery storage when supply exceeds demand? Where does the excess go?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — WORST CASE
• Zero solar, calm wind, peak demand
• PREDICT FIRST: How long do batteries last? When does fossil backup kick in?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — OPTIMIZATION
• Vary mix to minimize cost and emissions
• PREDICT FIRST: What percentage of renewables achieves the best balance of cost, reliability, and emissions?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The last 10-20 percent of fossil fuel replacement is exponentially harder than the first 80 percent due to intermittency gaps
• Battery storage is essential but currently too expensive to cover multi-day renewable droughts without fossil backup
• Overbuilding renewable capacity to handle worst-case scenarios dramatically increases cost but reduces emissions
• Geographic diversity helps -- connecting solar-rich and wind-rich regions reduces the probability of system-wide intermittency

THE ANSWER: We cannot simply swap fossil plants for renewables because the sun and wind are intermittent -- they produce power when nature allows, not when humans need it. At night, on calm days, and during storms, renewable output drops to zero. Batteries can bridge short gaps but cannot economically cover multi-day droughts. Some fossil fuel backup remains necessary for reliability until storage technology improves dramatically. The optimization challenge is finding the mix of solar, wind, storage, and backup that minimizes cost AND emissions while keeping the grid reliable 99.97 percent of the time.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Sunny Windy Day. Peak solar, strong wind, moderate demand.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Worst Case.
Zero solar, calm wind, peak demand.

Before you run it — make a prediction. How long do batteries last? When does fossil backup kick in?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Optimization. Vary mix to minimize cost and emissions.
What percentage of renewables achieves the best balance of cost, reliability, and emissions?

Here's what our model reveals: We cannot simply swap fossil plants for renewables because the sun and wind are intermittent -- they produce power when nature allows, not when humans need it. At night, on calm days, and during storms, renewable output drops to zero. Batteries can bridge short gaps but cannot economically cover multi-day droughts. Some fossil fuel backup remains necessary for reliability until storage technology improves dramatically. The optimization challenge is finding the mix of solar, wind, storage, and backup that minimizes cost AND emissions while keeping the grid reliable 99.97 percent of the time.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Renewable Energy Grid Optimization: Powering the Future
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The clean energy transition is the defining engineering challenge of our generation. While renewable energy costs have plummeted, the fundamental challenge of intermittency remains: the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow, and society demands electricity 24/7.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-PS3-3, HS-ETS1-3: Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another. Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
  Students optimize multi-variable energy systems, balancing competing objectives using computational models and scenario analysis.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS3.D Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life
  Energy transformation from solar radiation and wind kinetic energy to electrical energy involves efficiency losses and intermittency challenges.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students model energy flows through a grid system, tracking generation, storage, transmission losses, and consumption.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Grid Intermittency, Energy Storage, Dispatchable Generation, Grid Balancing
□ Prepare Why can't we just replace all fossil fuel power plants with solar panels and wind turbines tomorrow discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify solar output, wind output, battery storage, grid demand, fossil backup, transmission efficiency, cost per kWh, and carbon emissions as the 8 grid components.
• Establish: Students map supply-demand dynamics: renewables feed demand directly, excess charges batteries, batteries discharge when needed, fossil backup fills remaining gaps.
• Visualize: Students build a model optimizing the trade-offs between cost, emissions, and reliability across different energy mixes.
• Evaluate: Students run sunny, worst-case, and optimization scenarios to find the best achievable energy mix.
• Revise: Students add hydrogen storage, nuclear baseload, or demand response to explore advanced grid strategies.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Intermittency Challenge:
  Solar produces maximum power at noon but zero at night. Wind varies hourly and seasonally. Grid operators must match supply to demand in real time. Even a few minutes of mismatch causes blackouts. Fossil fuel plants can be turned on and off as needed -- renewables cannot.

• The Storage Gap:
  Current battery technology can bridge hours of intermittency but not days or weeks. A week-long calm, cloudy period would exhaust any economically feasible battery system. Alternative storage like pumped hydro and hydrogen is promising but limited by geography and cost.

• The Last 20 Percent Problem:
  Getting to 50-60 percent renewables is relatively straightforward. Getting to 80 percent requires massive storage. Getting to 100 percent requires solving multi-day and seasonal intermittency gaps that current technology cannot economically address. Each additional percent of renewables costs more than the last.

• Grid Physics:
  Electricity must be consumed the instant it is generated. The grid operates at exactly 60 Hz and must be balanced continuously. Too much supply raises frequency; too little drops it. Either extreme damages equipment and causes cascading failures. This physical constraint makes grid management fundamentally different from other optimization problems.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Renewables are too expensive"
  Reality: Solar and wind are now the CHEAPEST sources of new electricity generation. The cost challenge is in STORAGE and grid integration, not generation. The total system cost including storage is higher than generation alone, but still competitive with new fossil fuel plants in most regions.
  Strategy: Separate the costs: solar panels are cheap. Batteries are expensive. The headline cost of solar is misleading because it does not include the storage needed to make it reliable.

• "We can go 100 percent renewable immediately"
  Reality: The intermittency problem makes 100 percent renewables extremely challenging with current technology. Multi-day and seasonal gaps require storage capacity that does not yet exist at affordable scale. A rapid transition without adequate storage would cause blackouts.
  Strategy: Model it: run your grid through a week of cloudy calm weather. How much storage do you need? Now price it. That is why the transition takes time.

• "Nuclear is too dangerous for clean energy"
  Reality: Modern nuclear power has the lowest death rate per unit of energy of any source, including solar and wind. It provides reliable, zero-carbon baseload power that complements intermittent renewables. The main challenges are cost, construction time, and waste storage -- not safety.
  Strategy: Compare data: nuclear causes 0.03 deaths per TWh. Coal causes 24.6. Even solar causes 0.05 from manufacturing and installation accidents. Nuclear is statistically the safest.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why can't we just replace all fossil fuel power plants with solar panels and wind turbines tomorrow?
Answer: We cannot simply swap fossil plants for renewables because the sun and wind are intermittent -- they produce power when nature allows, not when humans need it. At night, on calm days, and during storms, renewable output drops to zero. Batteries can bridge short gaps but cannot economically cover multi-day droughts. Some fossil fuel backup remains necessary for reliability until storage technology improves dramatically. The optimization challenge is finding the mix of solar, wind, storage, and backup that minimizes cost AND emissions while keeping the grid reliable 99.97 percent of the time.

Simulation Answers:
• Sunny Windy Day: With maximum solar and wind, supply far exceeds demand. Excess energy charges batteries to full capacity. Fossil backup is not needed. Cost per kWh is at its lowest and carbon emissions approach zero. This is the ideal scenario that occurs perhaps 30-40 percent of the time.
• Worst Case: With zero solar and calm wind, batteries discharge rapidly. Depending on capacity, they last 4-12 hours. Once depleted, fossil backup activates, sharply increasing emissions and cost. This scenario reveals why 100 percent renewables requires solving the multi-day storage problem.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is the last 20 percent hardest?
  A: Getting to 80 percent renewables mostly requires overbuilding solar and wind to handle average demand. But the last 20 percent requires handling the WORST-CASE scenario: multiple days of low sun and wind. The storage needed for worst-case is vastly more expensive than for average-case. Each additional percentage point requires exponentially more storage investment.
• Q: What trade-offs constrain grid design?
  A: Cost, reliability, and emissions form a three-way trade-off. Minimizing emissions requires massive renewable overbuilding and storage (expensive). Minimizing cost favors some fossil backup (increases emissions). Maximizing reliability requires dispatchable backup (either expensive storage or fossil fuel). No design optimizes all three simultaneously.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Regional Clean Energy Grid
Mission: Design the optimal energy mix for a region that achieves maximum renewable penetration while maintaining grid reliability and minimizing cost.
Scenario: A region of 5 million people must achieve 90 percent clean energy by 2035. Design the energy portfolio: how much solar, wind, storage, and backup do you need? What does it cost? How reliable is it during extreme weather?
Introduction: A region of 5 million people must reach 90 percent clean energy by 2035. Students design the optimal portfolio balancing solar, wind, storage, and backup.

Key Concepts:
• Capacity Factor: Solar panels produce power about 25 percent of the time, wind turbines about 35 percent. You must install 3-4x the capacity to generate the equivalent of a 100 percent-available source.
• Duration Matching: Batteries handle hourly gaps. Pumped hydro handles daily gaps. Hydrogen or nuclear handles seasonal gaps. The right storage depends on the gap duration.
• Geographic Diversification: Connecting distant solar and wind regions reduces the probability of system-wide intermittency. When one region is cloudy, another may be sunny.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design optimizes all three objectives with quantified trade-offs, handles worst-case scenarios, uses geographic diversity, and justifies all choices with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Design achieves high renewable penetration, addresses storage needs, and quantifies cost and emissions
• Developing (2): Design includes renewables and storage but does not address worst-case scenarios or quantify trade-offs
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or does not account for intermittency and grid reliability

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Pre-drawn supply-demand graph showing solar output, wind output, battery charge/discharge, and fossil backup over 24 hours
  • Use a bank account analogy: renewables are your income (variable), batteries are your savings, fossil is a credit card (costly but always available)
  • Sentence frames: When renewable output drops below demand by __ MW, batteries can cover __ hours before fossil backup must provide __ MW

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the duck curve phenomenon in California and model how overproduction midday creates grid management challenges
  • Calculate the battery capacity needed to power your city for 3 days of zero renewable output and estimate the cost
  • Compare grid strategies: Germany's wind-heavy approach vs. Australia's solar-heavy approach vs. France's nuclear baseload

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the capacity factor-adjusted cost: if solar panels cost $1 per watt but produce power 25 percent of the time, what is the effective cost per watt of reliable power?
  • ELA: Write an opinion piece evaluating whether 100 percent renewable energy is achievable by 2050, using model evidence to support your argument.
  • Social Studies: Research energy justice: who benefits from cheap renewables and who is burdened by grid infrastructure like transmission lines and battery factories?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how intermittent renewable sources interact with storage and backup to meet grid demand
• Analyze the optimization trade-offs between cost, reliability, and carbon emissions
• Design a grid energy mix that achieves maximum renewable penetration with acceptable reliability

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Which factor MOST limits how much renewable energy a grid can use: (a) panel/turbine cost, (b) storage cost and capacity, (c) transmission distance, (d) public opinion?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain why a grid with 80 percent renewables might cost twice as much as one with 50 percent renewables, even though the additional solar panels are cheap.
