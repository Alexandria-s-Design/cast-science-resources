### Title
**Why Your Phone Battery Dies So Fast — Energy Conversion, Efficiency, and the Heat Tax**

### Overview
Every device you own is a chain of energy conversions, and every link in that chain leaks energy as heat. Understanding why requires grasping the fundamental physics of energy transformation and the inescapable reality of the second law of thermodynamics. Students investigate the driving question: Why does your phone die in 3 hours of gaming but lasts all day on standby? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 1: Foundations

### NGSS Standard
**HS-PS3-1, HS-PS3-3**: Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known. Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify the components that consume energy in a mobile device
- Model how energy converts from chemical to electrical to heat
- Explain why energy conversion is never 100% efficient
- Predict battery life under different usage scenarios

### Component List (Starting Model: 5 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Screen Brightness | External | How much power the display consumes. Higher brightness requires more energy to produce light. |
| Processing Load | External | How hard the CPU/GPU works. Games and video demand maximum processing; texting uses minimal. |
| Battery Capacity | Internal | Total stored chemical energy available. Degrades over charge cycles as battery chemistry breaks down. |
| Heat Generation | Internal | Wasted energy converted to thermal energy. More processing and brightness means more heat. |
| Battery Life | Internal | How long the device operates before running out. Determined by capacity minus all energy drains. |

WHY YOUR PHONE BATTERY DIES SO FAST

Energy Conversion, Efficiency, and the Heat Tax.
Why does your phone die in 3 hours of gaming but lasts all day on standby?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Screen Brightness" — how much power the display consumes
  ○ Click "Processing Load" — how hard the cpu/gpu works
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Battery Capacity" — total stored chemical energy available
  ○ Click "Heat Generation" — wasted energy converted to thermal energy
  ○ Click "Battery Life" — how long the device operates before running out

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 5 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"Why does your phone die in 3 hours of gaming but lasts all day on standby?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Screen Brightness' — that's external. How much power the display consumes.
Click on 'Processing Load' — that's external. How hard the CPU/GPU works.
Click on 'Battery Capacity' — that's internal. Total stored chemical energy available.
Click on 'Heat Generation' — that's internal. Wasted energy converted to thermal energy.
Click on 'Battery Life' — that's internal. How long the device operates before running out.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Screen Brightness and Processing Load are external because YOU control them — you choose how bright your screen is and what apps you run. Battery Capacity, Heat Generation, and Battery Life are internal because they are consequences of those choices and the physics of energy conversion.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 5 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Screen Brightness" and drag an arrow to "Battery Life"
• Click on "Processing Load" and drag an arrow to "Heat Generation"
• Click on "Heat Generation" and drag an arrow to "Battery Life"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Screen Brightness → Battery Life = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher screen brightness draws more power from the battery, converting more chemical energy to light (plus wasted heat), reducing the time the battery can last.

  ○ Processing Load → Heat Generation = POSITIVE (+)
    More intensive processing means more electrical energy flowing through transistors, and more energy lost as heat through electrical resistance. Gaming generates several watts of heat.

  ○ Heat Generation → Battery Life = NEGATIVE (−)
    Heat represents wasted energy — every watt of heat is a watt that didn't go to useful function. More heat means faster energy depletion and shorter battery life.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 1 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: Your phone gets hot when you game. Where is that heat energy coming from — and where was it supposed to go instead?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Screen Brightness' and drag an arrow
over to 'Battery Life.'

Here's the key question: When screen brightness goes UP, does
battery life go UP or DOWN?

Higher screen brightness draws more power from the battery, converting more chemical energy to light (plus wasted heat), reducing the time the battery can last.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Processing Load' and drag an arrow
over to 'Heat Generation.'

Here's the key question: When processing load goes UP, does
heat generation go UP or DOWN?

More intensive processing means more electrical energy flowing through transistors, and more energy lost as heat through electrical resistance. Gaming generates several watts of heat.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Heat Generation' and drag an arrow
over to 'Battery Life.'

Here's the key question: When heat generation goes UP, does
battery life go UP or DOWN?

Heat represents wasted energy — every watt of heat is a watt that didn't go to useful function. More heat means faster energy depletion and shorter battery life.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 1
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

Your phone gets hot when you game. Where is that heat energy coming from — and where was it supposed to go instead?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Screen Brightness is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — HEAVY GAMING
• Screen Brightness: HIGH | Processing Load: HIGH
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: How long will the battery last? How much heat will be generated?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — STANDBY MODE
• Screen Brightness: LOW | Processing Load: LOW
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: How much longer does the battery last compared to gaming?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — BRIGHTNESS TEST
• Processing Load: MEDIUM | Screen Brightness: LOW → HIGH
• PREDICT FIRST: Which factor drains battery faster — screen brightness or processing load?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Energy conversion from battery chemical energy to screen light and computation is never 100% efficient
• Heat generation is wasted energy — every watt of heat is a watt NOT powering your screen or apps
• Screen brightness and processing load have a multiplicative effect on battery drain
• Battery capacity degrades over time, meaning the same usage pattern drains faster on an old phone

THE ANSWER: Your phone battery dies fast during gaming because both the screen and processor are drawing maximum power simultaneously. Energy converts from chemical (battery) to electrical to light (screen) and computation (CPU), but at every step some energy is lost as heat. Gaming might use 5-8 watts while standby uses 0.1-0.3 watts — a 20-50x difference. That's why 3 hours of gaming equals 24+ hours of standby.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Heavy Gaming. Screen Brightness: HIGH | Processing Load: HIGH.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Standby Mode.
Screen Brightness: LOW | Processing Load: LOW.

Before you run it — make a prediction. Predict: How much longer does the battery last compared to gaming?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Brightness Test. Processing Load: MEDIUM | Screen Brightness: LOW → HIGH.
Which factor drains battery faster — screen brightness or processing load?

Here's what our model reveals: Your phone battery dies fast during gaming because both the screen and processor are drawing maximum power simultaneously. Energy converts from chemical (battery) to electrical to light (screen) and computation (CPU), but at every step some energy is lost as heat. Gaming might use 5-8 watts while standby uses 0.1-0.3 watts — a 20-50x difference. That's why 3 hours of gaming equals 24+ hours of standby.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Screen Brightness?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Processing Load?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Battery Age — How old the battery is measured in charge cycles. Lithium-ion batteries lose about 20% capacity after 500 full cycles.
   • Ambient Temperature — Environmental temperature affects battery chemistry. Extreme cold reduces available capacity; extreme heat accelerates degradation.
   • Background Apps — Programs running behind the scenes that consume power even when you're not using them — GPS, notifications, data syncing.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • How Batteries Store Energy — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Energy Conversion Chain — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is it impossible to build a device with 100% energy efficiency?
   • How does the second law of thermodynamics relate to your phone getting hot?
   • What trade-offs do engineers make when designing phone power systems?
   • Why do older phones have worse battery life even with the same usage patterns?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 5 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Battery Age. How old the battery is measured in charge cycles. Lithium-ion batteries lose about 20% capacity after 500 full cycles.
How would you model that?

Ambient Temperature. Environmental temperature affects battery chemistry. Extreme cold reduces available capacity; extreme heat accelerates degradation.
How would you model that?

Background Apps. Programs running behind the scenes that consume power even when you're not using them — GPS, notifications, data syncing.
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Your Phone Battery Dies So Fast
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Every device you own is a chain of energy conversions, and every link in that chain leaks energy as heat. Understanding why requires grasping the fundamental physics of energy transformation and the inescapable reality of the second law of thermodynamics.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-PS3-1, HS-PS3-3: Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known. Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• SEP: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
  Students create computational models to calculate energy changes and predict battery life under different usage scenarios.
• DCI: PS3.A: Definitions of Energy / PS3.D: Energy in Chemical Processes
  Energy is stored in batteries as chemical energy and converted through multiple steps. At each conversion, some energy is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing efficiency.
• CCC: Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation
  Energy is conserved but degrades in quality — chemical energy converts to electrical to light/computation plus waste heat. Tracking energy flows reveals why systems are never perfectly efficient.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Energy Conversion, Thermal Dissipation, Power Draw, Efficiency
□ Prepare Why does your phone die in 3 hours of gaming but lasts all day on standby discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify screen brightness, processing load, battery capacity, heat generation, and battery life as components of the phone energy system.
• Establish: Students discover that brightness and processing load both drain battery (+heat, -life) while heat represents wasted energy.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing energy flowing from battery through components with heat as a loss pathway.
• Evaluate: Students run gaming, standby, and brightness test scenarios to compare energy drain rates.
• Revise: Students add battery age, ambient temperature, or background apps to create a more realistic energy model.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• How Batteries Store Energy:
  Lithium-ion batteries store energy in chemical bonds. During discharge, lithium ions flow from the anode to the cathode through an electrolyte, releasing electrons that travel through the external circuit (your phone's components) as electrical current. A typical smartphone battery stores about 15 Watt-hours of energy — equivalent to lifting a 1-kg weight about 5,500 meters.

• The Energy Conversion Chain:
  Battery chemical energy → electrical current → multiple endpoints: screen (electrical → light), processor (electrical → computation + heat), speakers (electrical → sound), radios (electrical → electromagnetic waves). At every conversion step, the second law of thermodynamics demands that some energy degrades to thermal energy. No conversion is 100% efficient.

• Why Phones Get Hot:
  Heat generation in phones comes from electrical resistance in circuits (Joule heating), transistor switching in processors, and LED/OLED inefficiency in screens. A phone running a demanding game might generate 3-5 watts of heat — equivalent to a small nightlight. This is energy your battery paid for but that did nothing useful. Modern phones use thermal throttling to reduce performance when temperatures get dangerous.

• Battery Degradation:
  Lithium-ion batteries degrade with every charge cycle. Repeated expansion and contraction of electrode materials causes microscopic cracks, and a thin layer of lithium compounds (SEI layer) gradually grows thicker, trapping lithium ions permanently. After 500 full cycles, most batteries retain only 80% of original capacity. Fast charging and extreme temperatures accelerate degradation.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Closing apps saves battery"
  Reality: On modern phones, background apps are 'frozen' and use almost zero power. Force-closing them actually WASTES energy because reopening them requires more processing than leaving them suspended. The real battery drains are screen brightness, cellular/GPS radios, and active processing.
  Strategy: Show battery usage stats on a phone. The screen is almost always #1, not background apps.

• "Charging overnight damages the battery"
  Reality: Modern phones have smart charging circuits that stop charging at 100% and maintain the battery. However, keeping a lithium-ion battery at 100% charge does cause slightly faster degradation over months. The bigger damage comes from extreme heat and fast-charging frequently.
  Strategy: Explain that 'damage' is about chemistry: keeping lithium ions at maximum voltage causes slightly faster SEI growth. It's real but very slow.

• "Bigger battery always means longer life"
  Reality: Battery size (mAh) is only half the equation. A phone with a 5,000 mAh battery but a power-hungry screen and processor might last shorter than a 3,000 mAh phone with efficient components. Total battery life = capacity ÷ average power draw. Efficiency matters as much as size.
  Strategy: Analogy: A bigger gas tank doesn't help if your car's engine is inefficient. A Prius with 11 gallons outlasts a truck with 30 gallons.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why does your phone die in 3 hours of gaming but lasts all day on standby?
Answer: Your phone battery dies fast during gaming because both the screen and processor are drawing maximum power simultaneously. Energy converts from chemical (battery) to electrical to light (screen) and computation (CPU), but at every step some energy is lost as heat. Gaming might use 5-8 watts while standby uses 0.1-0.3 watts — a 20-50x difference. That's why 3 hours of gaming equals 24+ hours of standby.

Simulation Answers:
• Heavy Gaming Scenario: With both Screen Brightness and Processing Load at HIGH, Battery Life drops dramatically — the phone might last only 2-3 hours. Heat Generation spikes as both the screen and processor draw maximum power. The battery is draining through both high-power pathways simultaneously, plus paying the 'heat tax' on both.
• Brightness Test Scenario: Increasing Screen Brightness from LOW to HIGH while keeping Processing Load at MEDIUM shows that the screen is a major battery drain — often the single biggest power consumer. However, the processor during gaming typically generates MORE heat because transistor switching is less efficient than LED/OLED light production.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is 100% energy efficiency impossible?
  A: The second law of thermodynamics states that whenever energy converts from one form to another, some energy always degrades to thermal energy (heat). In a phone, chemical energy → electrical energy → light/computation, and each arrow represents a conversion where some energy is lost as heat. Even the best processors lose 30-40% of their energy as heat. This is a fundamental law of physics, not an engineering failure.
• Q: How does battery age affect your model?
  A: As a battery ages through charge cycles, its internal chemistry degrades — the SEI layer thickens, trapping lithium ions permanently. This means Battery Capacity decreases over time even though Screen Brightness and Processing Load stay the same. Our model predicts that the same usage pattern will drain an old battery much faster because there's simply less stored energy to begin with.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: The Battery Optimization Challenge
Mission: Design a power management system that maximizes battery life for a student who needs their phone to last a full school day (8 hours) with moderate use.
Scenario: A student's phone has a 4,000 mAh battery. They need to text, check social media during breaks, watch a 30-minute video at lunch, and use GPS to get home. Design power settings that keep the phone alive all day without carrying a charger.
Introduction: Challenge students to think like power management engineers. Real phone companies employ hundreds of engineers whose entire job is optimizing energy flows to maximize battery life without sacrificing user experience.

Key Concepts:
• Power Budget: The total energy available divided among all consuming components. Engineers must 'budget' watts the way you budget money — spending more on one thing means less for everything else.
• Adaptive Brightness: Technology that automatically adjusts screen brightness based on ambient light. This saves significant battery by avoiding unnecessarily high brightness in dim environments.
• Thermal Throttling: When a phone gets too hot, it automatically reduces processor speed to prevent damage. This is why games sometimes lag after 30 minutes — the phone is protecting itself by sacrificing performance.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Power plan accounts for all major energy consumers, includes time-based scheduling, references model data, and addresses realistic daily activities
• Proficient (3): Power plan identifies key energy drains with reasonable settings, supported by simulation evidence
• Developing (2): Power plan addresses some energy factors but lacks scheduling detail or evidence
• Beginning (1): Power plan is incomplete or doesn't connect to energy conversion concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a visual energy flow diagram showing battery → components → heat as a pre-made reference
  • Use a water tank analogy: battery = full tank, usage = drain valves, heat = leaks in the pipes
  • Sentence frames: 'When screen brightness increases, battery life __ because more energy is converted to __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research wireless charging efficiency — how much energy is lost converting wall AC → charger DC → wireless → phone battery?
  • Compare the energy density of lithium-ion batteries to gasoline. Why can't phone batteries match the energy of fuel?
  • Investigate solid-state batteries: How would they change the energy conversion efficiency model?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate: A 4,000 mAh, 3.8V battery stores 15.2 Wh. If gaming draws 5.5W and standby draws 0.2W, calculate battery life for each and the ratio.
  • ELA: Write a consumer guide explaining to non-technical users WHY their phone battery dies fast and what they can actually do about it.
  • Social Studies: Research the environmental impact of lithium mining for phone batteries. What are the human and ecological costs of our energy-hungry devices?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Calculate energy conversion efficiency from battery chemical energy to useful device output
• Model and predict battery life under varying usage conditions
• Explain energy dissipation and the second law of thermodynamics in consumer electronics

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Calculate: A phone battery stores 15.4 Wh of energy. The screen uses 2.5 W, the processor uses 3.0 W during gaming, and 0.8 W of heat is generated. How long can the phone game before dying? What's the energy efficiency?
• Explain: Two identical phones with identical batteries are used for 4 hours — one for texting, one for gaming. The gaming phone is nearly dead while the texting phone has 70% battery. Use your energy model to explain why.

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Energy Conversion             
___ Thermal Dissipation           
___ Power Draw                    
___ Efficiency                    

A. The process of changing energy from one form to another — e.g., chemical energy in a battery to electrical energy to light from the screen
B. Energy lost as heat during any energy conversion process — this is the 'heat tax' you pay every time energy changes form
C. The rate at which a device consumes energy, measured in watts — higher power draw means faster battery drain
D. The ratio of useful energy output to total energy input — no device is 100% efficient because some energy always becomes heat

STEM CHALLENGE: The Battery Optimization Challenge
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a power management system that maximizes battery life for a student who needs their phone to last a full school day (8 hours) with moderate use.

SCENARIO: A student's phone has a 4,000 mAh battery. They need to text, check social media during breaks, watch a 30-minute video at lunch, and use GPS to get home. Design power settings that keep the phone alive all day without carrying a charger.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which energy-consuming components can you reduce without ruining the experience?
• When during the day should you allow high-power activities vs. conserve?
• What's the minimum acceptable brightness and processing for each activity?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What are the highest-priority functions the phone must perform?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you schedule high-power and low-power activities across the day?

  _________________________________________________________

• What trade-offs are you making between experience quality and battery life?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you test whether your power plan actually works for 8 hours?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Power plan accounts for all major energy consumers, includes time-based scheduling, references model data, and addresses realistic daily activities
• Proficient (3): Power plan identifies key energy drains with reasonable settings, supported by simulation evidence
• Developing (2): Power plan addresses some energy factors but lacks scheduling detail or evidence
• Beginning (1): Power plan is incomplete or doesn't connect to energy conversion concepts
