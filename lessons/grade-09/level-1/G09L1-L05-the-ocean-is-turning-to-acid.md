### Title
**The Ocean Is Turning to Acid — How CO2 Emissions Are Dissolving Marine Life**

### Overview
Ocean acidification is often called 'the other CO2 problem' — less famous than global warming but potentially just as devastating. The chemistry is straightforward, the evidence is irrefutable, and the consequences for marine life are already visible. Students investigate the driving question: How is the CO2 from your car slowly dissolving the shells of sea creatures thousands of miles away? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 1: Foundations

### NGSS Standard
**HS-ESS3-6, HS-PS1-7**: Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified due to human activity. Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are conserved during a chemical reaction.

### Learning Objectives
- Trace the path of CO2 from emission to ocean absorption
- Model how dissolved CO2 changes ocean pH through chemical reactions
- Explain the relationship between ocean acidification and coral/shell health
- Predict the impact of different emission scenarios on marine ecosystems

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| CO2 Emissions | External | The rate at which humans release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industry. |
| Ocean CO2 Absorption | Internal | How much atmospheric CO2 dissolves into seawater. The ocean absorbs about 30% of human CO2 emissions. |
| Ocean pH | Internal | The acidity level of seawater. As more CO2 dissolves, pH decreases (becomes more acidic). |
| Coral Health | Internal | The ability of coral reefs and shell-building organisms to survive. Lower pH dissolves their calcium carbonate structures. |

THE OCEAN IS TURNING TO ACID

How CO2 Emissions Are Dissolving Marine Life.
How is the CO2 from your car slowly dissolving the shells of sea creatures thousands of miles away?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "CO2 Emissions" — the rate at which humans release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Ocean CO2 Absorption" — how much atmospheric co2 dissolves into seawater
  ○ Click "Ocean pH" — the acidity level of seawater
  ○ Click "Coral Health" — the ability of coral reefs and shell-building organisms to survive

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How is the CO2 from your car slowly dissolving the shells of sea creatures thousands of miles away?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'CO2 Emissions' — that's external. The rate at which humans release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industry.
Click on 'Ocean CO2 Absorption' — that's internal. How much atmospheric CO2 dissolves into seawater.
Click on 'Ocean pH' — that's internal. The acidity level of seawater.
Click on 'Coral Health' — that's internal. The ability of coral reefs and shell-building organisms to survive.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

CO2 Emissions is external because it's driven by human activity — we choose how much fossil fuel to burn. Ocean CO2 Absorption, Ocean pH, and Coral Health are all internal because they are consequences of CO2 levels — the ocean chemistry responds automatically to atmospheric CO2 concentration.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "CO2 Emissions" and drag an arrow to "Ocean CO2 Absorption"
• Click on "Ocean CO2 Absorption" and drag an arrow to "Ocean pH"
• Click on "Ocean pH" and drag an arrow to "Coral Health"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ CO2 Emissions → Ocean CO2 Absorption = POSITIVE (+)
    More atmospheric CO2 means more dissolves into the ocean. The ocean absorbs roughly 30% of our emissions — more emissions means more absorption.

  ○ Ocean CO2 Absorption → Ocean pH = NEGATIVE (−)
    More dissolved CO2 creates more carbonic acid, releasing hydrogen ions that lower pH. Every additional ton of CO2 absorbed makes the ocean measurably more acidic.

  ○ Ocean pH → Coral Health = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher pH (less acidic) supports healthy coral growth. As pH drops, coral's calcium carbonate structures dissolve faster than organisms can build them, leading to reef death.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: The ocean absorbs 30% of our CO2 emissions. Is the ocean helping us or hurting itself — or both?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'CO2 Emissions' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ocean CO2 Absorption.'

Here's the key question: When co2 emissions goes UP, does
ocean co2 absorption go UP or DOWN?

More atmospheric CO2 means more dissolves into the ocean. The ocean absorbs roughly 30% of our emissions — more emissions means more absorption.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Ocean CO2 Absorption' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ocean pH.'

Here's the key question: When ocean co2 absorption goes UP, does
ocean ph go UP or DOWN?

More dissolved CO2 creates more carbonic acid, releasing hydrogen ions that lower pH. Every additional ton of CO2 absorbed makes the ocean measurably more acidic.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Ocean pH' and drag an arrow
over to 'Coral Health.'

Here's the key question: When ocean ph goes UP, does
coral health go UP or DOWN?

Higher pH (less acidic) supports healthy coral growth. As pH drops, coral's calcium carbonate structures dissolve faster than organisms can build them, leading to reef death.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

The ocean absorbs 30% of our CO2 emissions. Is the ocean helping us or hurting itself — or both?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When CO2 Emissions is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — CURRENT TRAJECTORY
• CO2 Emissions: HIGH (current rate)
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: What happens to ocean pH and coral health over 50 years at current emission rates?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — PARIS AGREEMENT
• CO2 Emissions: MEDIUM (reduced)
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: Does reducing emissions stop acidification or just slow it?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — ZERO EMISSIONS
• CO2 Emissions: LOW (near zero)
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: If we stopped all emissions today, how long would the ocean take to recover?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The ocean acts as a massive CO2 sink — absorbing billions of tons yearly — but this absorption comes at the cost of increasing acidity
• Ocean pH has dropped 0.1 units since pre-industrial times — a 30% increase in hydrogen ion concentration
• Even under the Paris Agreement, ocean acidification continues for decades because CO2 already in the atmosphere keeps dissolving
• Coral reefs and shellfish are the first casualties because their calcium carbonate structures literally dissolve in more acidic water

THE ANSWER: CO2 from your car enters the atmosphere, and about 30% dissolves into the ocean. When CO2 meets seawater, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which releases hydrogen ions that lower pH. This more acidic water dissolves the calcium carbonate that corals and shellfish need to build their structures. The chemistry is simple and inescapable: more CO2 in = more acid = less coral. The ocean has been absorbing our CO2 for decades — it's helped slow atmospheric warming but is paying with its own chemistry.
```

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Current Trajectory. CO2 Emissions: HIGH (current rate).
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Paris Agreement.
CO2 Emissions: MEDIUM (reduced).

Before you run it — make a prediction. Predict: Does reducing emissions stop acidification or just slow it?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Zero Emissions. CO2 Emissions: LOW (near zero).
Predict: If we stopped all emissions today, how long would the ocean take to recover?

Here's what our model reveals: CO2 from your car enters the atmosphere, and about 30% dissolves into the ocean. When CO2 meets seawater, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which releases hydrogen ions that lower pH. This more acidic water dissolves the calcium carbonate that corals and shellfish need to build their structures. The chemistry is simple and inescapable: more CO2 in = more acid = less coral. The ocean has been absorbing our CO2 for decades — it's helped slow atmospheric warming but is paying with its own chemistry.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF CO2 Emissions?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Water Temperature — Warmer water holds less dissolved CO2 but accelerates chemical reactions. Rising ocean temperatures interact with acidification in complex ways.
   • Biological Buffering — Healthy marine ecosystems can partially buffer pH changes through photosynthesis (which consumes CO2). Losing marine plants reduces this natural buffer.
   • Deep Ocean Circulation — Ocean currents carry acidified surface water to the deep ocean. This means acidification impacts spread globally, even to remote areas far from emission sources.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Chemistry of Ocean Acidification — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Scale of the Problem — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is a 0.1 pH change considered significant when the scale goes from 0 to 14?
   • How does the law of conservation of mass explain where atmospheric CO2 ends up in the ocean?
   • Why can't marine organisms simply adapt to more acidic water?
   • What makes ocean acidification an especially difficult problem to reverse?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Water Temperature. Warmer water holds less dissolved CO2 but accelerates chemical reactions. Rising ocean temperatures interact with acidification in complex ways.
How would you model that?

Biological Buffering. Healthy marine ecosystems can partially buffer pH changes through photosynthesis (which consumes CO2). Losing marine plants reduces this natural buffer.
How would you model that?

Deep Ocean Circulation. Ocean currents carry acidified surface water to the deep ocean. This means acidification impacts spread globally, even to remote areas far from emission sources.
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Ocean Is Turning to Acid
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Ocean acidification is often called 'the other CO2 problem' — less famous than global warming but potentially just as devastating. The chemistry is straightforward, the evidence is irrefutable, and the consequences for marine life are already visible.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS3-6, HS-PS1-7: Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified due to human activity. Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are conserved during a chemical reaction.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• SEP: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
  Students use computational models to represent the quantitative relationships between CO2 emissions, ocean absorption, pH changes, and biological impacts.
• DCI: ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems / PS1.B: Chemical Reactions
  Human CO2 emissions are absorbed by the ocean, driving chemical reactions that produce carbonic acid and lower pH. Atoms are conserved — the carbon in your exhaust becomes the acid dissolving coral.
• CCC: Stability and Change
  The ocean's pH has been stable for millions of years. Human CO2 emissions have disrupted this stability faster than marine organisms can adapt, pushing the system toward a new — and potentially catastrophic — equilibrium.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Ocean Acidification, pH Scale, Carbonic Acid, Calcification
□ Prepare How is the CO2 from your car slowly dissolving the shells of sea creatures thousands of miles away discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify CO2 emissions, ocean CO2 absorption, ocean pH, and coral health as components of the ocean acidification system.
• Establish: Students discover that emissions drive absorption (+), absorption drives pH down (-), and lower pH destroys coral health (-).
• Visualize: Students build a model showing the causal chain from human emissions to marine ecosystem destruction.
• Evaluate: Students run current trajectory, Paris Agreement, and zero emission scenarios to compare outcomes.
• Revise: Students add water temperature, biological buffering, or deep ocean circulation to explore more complex dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Chemistry of Ocean Acidification:
  When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid: CO2 + H2O → H2CO3. This carbonic acid then dissociates, releasing hydrogen ions (H+) that lower pH: H2CO3 → H+ + HCO3-. The excess hydrogen ions also react with carbonate ions (CO3²-) that marine organisms need for building shells: H+ + CO3²- → HCO3-. This is why acidification is a double hit — it increases acidity AND removes the building blocks organisms need.

• The Scale of the Problem:
  The ocean has absorbed approximately 525 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution — about 30% of all human emissions. Surface ocean pH has dropped from 8.2 to 8.1. While 0.1 sounds tiny, pH is logarithmic: this represents a 30% increase in hydrogen ion concentration. Current projections show pH could drop to 7.8 by 2100 — a 150% increase in acidity from pre-industrial levels.

• Biological Impacts:
  Organisms that build calcium carbonate structures — corals, oysters, clams, sea urchins, and many plankton species — are most vulnerable. Below a pH threshold, their shells and skeletons literally dissolve faster than they can build them. Coral reefs, which support 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor, are facing dissolution. Pteropods (sea butterflies) at the base of many food chains are already showing shell thinning.

• The Recovery Problem:
  Even if CO2 emissions stopped completely today, ocean acidification would continue for decades as existing atmospheric CO2 continues dissolving. Full recovery of ocean pH would take tens of thousands of years because the deep ocean circulation that mixes surface and deep water operates on millennial timescales. This makes prevention far more effective than cure.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "The ocean is basic so it can handle some acid"
  Reality: While seawater is indeed slightly basic (pH 8.1), marine life evolved over millions of years in this exact pH range. A shift of 0.1 pH units represents a 30% change in acidity — equivalent to changing the oxygen concentration in air by 30%. Organisms can't just 'handle' that.
  Strategy: Analogy: Human blood pH is 7.4. A change of just 0.2 pH units (to 7.2) causes acidosis and can be fatal. Small pH changes matter enormously to biology.

• "CO2 is natural so it can't be harmful"
  Reality: CO2 is natural and essential for photosynthesis. The problem isn't CO2 existing — it's the RATE of increase. Natural CO2 cycles take thousands of years; we've increased atmospheric CO2 by 50% in 150 years. The ocean can absorb CO2 gradually, but not at this pace. It's like the difference between rain (natural) and a flood (too much, too fast).
  Strategy: Show the Keeling Curve: atmospheric CO2 was 280 ppm for 10,000 years, then shot to 420 ppm in 150 years. That rate is unprecedented.

• "We can just add chemicals to fix the ocean"
  Reality: The ocean contains 1.335 billion cubic kilometers of water. To raise its pH by 0.1 units would require billions of tons of alkaline minerals. We'd need to mine, transport, and distribute more material than the entire global mining industry produces. And we'd need to keep doing it every year. Prevention (cutting emissions) is millions of times more practical than cure.
  Strategy: Calculate: The ocean volume is 1.335 × 10^18 cubic meters. How many tons of limestone would you need per cubic meter? Multiply out to see the absurdity.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How is the CO2 from your car slowly dissolving the shells of sea creatures thousands of miles away?
Answer: CO2 from your car enters the atmosphere, and about 30% dissolves into the ocean. When CO2 meets seawater, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which releases hydrogen ions that lower pH. This more acidic water dissolves the calcium carbonate that corals and shellfish need to build their structures. The chemistry is simple and inescapable: more CO2 in = more acid = less coral. The ocean has been absorbing our CO2 for decades — it's helped slow atmospheric warming but is paying with its own chemistry.

Simulation Answers:
• Current Trajectory: With CO2 Emissions at HIGH, ocean pH drops steadily from 8.1 toward 7.8 by 2100. Coral Health declines catastrophically as acidification crosses biological thresholds. Ocean CO2 Absorption actually increases initially (more atmospheric CO2 to absorb) but this 'service' destroys marine chemistry.
• Zero Emissions: Even at zero emissions, Ocean pH continues dropping for decades because the existing 420+ ppm atmospheric CO2 keeps dissolving. Recovery takes thousands of years because deep ocean circulation is extremely slow. This lag effect is the most important insight: prevention is far more effective than cure.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is a 0.1 pH change significant?
  A: The pH scale is logarithmic — each whole number represents a 10x change in hydrogen ion concentration. A drop from 8.2 to 8.1 means a 26% increase in H+ ions. Projected drops to 7.8 would mean a 150% increase. For organisms that evolved over millions of years in stable pH conditions, these changes happen thousands of times faster than natural variation, giving them no time to adapt.
• Q: Why can't the ocean just recover?
  A: Recovery requires removing excess CO2 from the entire ocean volume — about 1.335 billion cubic kilometers of water. The deep ocean, which contains 90% of ocean water, mixes with the surface only through slow thermohaline circulation that takes 500-1,000 years per cycle. Even if we stopped adding CO2 today, it would take 10,000-50,000 years for ocean chemistry to return to pre-industrial levels.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: The Coral Reef Rescue Plan
Mission: Design an intervention strategy that protects a coral reef from acidification while addressing the root cause of CO2 emissions.
Scenario: A Caribbean coral reef that supports local fishing and tourism is showing signs of bleaching and dissolution. Your team must propose a multi-pronged strategy: immediate reef protection, medium-term emission reduction, and long-term ocean chemistry restoration.
Introduction: Frame this as a real-world policy challenge: students are marine conservation consultants advising a Caribbean nation whose economy depends on coral reef tourism and fishing.

Key Concepts:
• Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement: Proposed geoengineering technique that adds alkaline minerals to seawater to neutralize acidity. Like adding antacid to the ocean. Currently experimental and the scale required is enormous.
• Marine Protected Areas: Designated ocean regions where human activities are restricted. MPAs can reduce LOCAL stresses (pollution, overfishing) to help reefs survive acidification, but they can't change ocean chemistry.
• Blue Carbon: Carbon captured and stored by coastal ecosystems like mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems removes CO2 from the water AND provides habitat.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses immediate reef protection, medium-term emission reduction, and long-term chemistry restoration with evidence from model simulations
• Proficient (3): Plan includes multiple intervention strategies with some model evidence
• Developing (2): Plan addresses either symptoms or causes but not both
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or doesn't connect to ocean acidification model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a pre-drawn CO2 pathway diagram: tailpipe → atmosphere → ocean surface → chemical reaction → coral
  • Use a hands-on demo: put chalk (CaCO3) in vinegar (acid) to show dissolution — same chemistry, faster timescale
  • Sentence frames: 'When CO2 emissions increase, ocean pH __ because __, which causes coral health to __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research ocean alkalinity enhancement — calculate how many tons of limestone you'd need to neutralize one year of CO2 absorption
  • Compare ocean acidification rates to the Permian-Triassic extinction (the Great Dying) — how do current rates compare?
  • Investigate how shellfish farming industries in the Pacific Northwest are already adapting to acidification

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate: If the ocean absorbs 9.3 billion tons of CO2 per year and current atmospheric CO2 is 420 ppm, model pH change over 10-year intervals using the carbonate chemistry equations.
  • ELA: Write a policy brief for a coastal senator explaining ocean acidification, its economic impacts on fishing communities, and recommended legislative action.
  • Social Studies: Research environmental justice: Which coastal communities and nations are most vulnerable to ocean acidification impacts, and which nations emit the most CO2?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the quantitative relationship between atmospheric CO2 and ocean pH
• Trace the conservation of carbon atoms from fossil fuel combustion through atmospheric CO2 to dissolved carbonic acid
• Predict biological impacts of continued acidification using computational evidence

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Trace: Follow a carbon atom from gasoline in a car engine, through the atmosphere, into the ocean, and into a chemical reaction with seawater. Write the chemical equations and explain each step.
• Evaluate: A policy advisor claims that 'the ocean is cleaning up our CO2 for free.' Using your model, explain why this statement is dangerously misleading.

PRE-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. What is the pH scale and what does it measure?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. Where does the CO2 from burning fossil fuels go after it enters the atmosphere?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. What are coral reefs made of and why are they important?

   _________________________________________________________

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Ocean Acidification           
___ pH Scale                      
___ Carbonic Acid                 
___ Calcification                 

A. The ongoing decrease in ocean pH caused by absorption of atmospheric CO2 — the ocean has become 30% more acidic since the Industrial Revolution
B. A measure of how acidic or basic a solution is, from 0 (extremely acidic) to 14 (extremely basic). Seawater has dropped from pH 8.2 to 8.1 — sounds small but it's a 30% increase in acidity
C. The weak acid (H2CO3) formed when CO2 dissolves in water — this is the chemical mechanism driving ocean acidification
D. The biological process marine organisms use to build shells and coral skeletons from calcium carbonate — acidification dissolves these structures

STEM CHALLENGE: The Coral Reef Rescue Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design an intervention strategy that protects a coral reef from acidification while addressing the root cause of CO2 emissions.

SCENARIO: A Caribbean coral reef that supports local fishing and tourism is showing signs of bleaching and dissolution. Your team must propose a multi-pronged strategy: immediate reef protection, medium-term emission reduction, and long-term ocean chemistry restoration.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Can we protect reefs locally while the global ocean continues to acidify?
• What's more effective: reducing emissions or directly treating ocean chemistry?
• How do you balance economic needs (fishing, tourism) with environmental protection?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What are the most urgent threats to the reef right now?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will your plan address both symptoms (acidification) and causes (emissions)?

  _________________________________________________________

• What trade-offs exist between immediate protection and long-term solutions?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you measure whether your intervention is actually working?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses immediate reef protection, medium-term emission reduction, and long-term chemistry restoration with evidence from model simulations
• Proficient (3): Plan includes multiple intervention strategies with some model evidence
• Developing (2): Plan addresses either symptoms or causes but not both
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or doesn't connect to ocean acidification model
