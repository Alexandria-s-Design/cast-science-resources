### Title
**Why Earthquakes Hit Some Cities Harder — Modeling Seismic Energy, Ground Conditions, and Urban Vulnerability**

### Overview
Earthquakes are among the most dramatic reminders that Earth's surface is not the stable, unchanging ground it appears to be. Beneath our feet, tectonic plates grind against each other at rates of centimeters per year, building enormous stress that is released in catastrophic bursts lasting seconds to minutes. But the earthquake itself is only half the story — what happens to seismic energy when it reaches the surface determines whether a city survives or collapses. Students investigate the driving question: Why do two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience completely different levels of destruction? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 1: Foundations

### NGSS Standard
**HS-ESS2-1**: Develop a model to illustrate how Earth's internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales to form continental and ocean-floor features.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how tectonic stress accumulates along fault lines and is released as seismic energy during an earthquake
- Explain how ground conditions amplify or dampen seismic waves, determining the severity of shaking at different locations
- Predict which urban areas are most vulnerable to earthquake damage based on geological and structural factors
- Analyze why building codes and soil conditions are as important as earthquake magnitude in determining destruction

### Component List (Starting Model: 5 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Tectonic Stress | External | The accumulated mechanical pressure along a fault zone caused by plate motion — measured in megapascals and building over years to centuries until it exceeds the fault's frictional strength |
| Fault Slip | Internal | The sudden movement along a fault plane when accumulated tectonic stress exceeds friction — the rupture length and displacement determine the earthquake's magnitude |
| Seismic Wave Energy | Internal | The total energy radiated as seismic waves during an earthquake, traveling through rock and soil at speeds of 3-8 km/s — the energy that shakes buildings and reshapes landscapes |
| Building Vulnerability | Internal | The susceptibility of structures to seismic damage based on construction materials, design, age, height, and whether the building was engineered to withstand earthquake forces |
| Ground Amplification | Internal | The degree to which local soil and geological conditions amplify or dampen incoming seismic waves — soft sediments can amplify shaking 2-10 times compared to solid bedrock |

WHY EARTHQUAKES HIT SOME CITIES HARDER

Modeling Seismic Energy, Ground Conditions, and Urban Vulnerability.
Why do two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience completely different levels of destruction?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Tectonic Stress" — the accumulated mechanical pressure along a fault zone caused by plate motion — measured in megapascals and building over years to centuries until it exceeds the fault's frictional strength
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Fault Slip" — the sudden movement along a fault plane when accumulated tectonic stress exceeds friction — the rupture length and displacement determine the earthquake's magnitude
  ○ Click "Seismic Wave Energy" — the total energy radiated as seismic waves during an earthquake
  ○ Click "Building Vulnerability" — the susceptibility of structures to seismic damage based on construction materials
  ○ Click "Ground Amplification" — the degree to which local soil and geological conditions amplify or dampen incoming seismic waves — soft sediments can amplify shaking 2-10 times compared to solid bedrock

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 5 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why do two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience completely different levels of destruction?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Tectonic Stress' — that's external. The accumulated mechanical pressure along a fault zone caused by plate motion — measured in megapascals and building over years to centuries until it exceeds the fault's frictional strength.
Click on 'Fault Slip' — that's internal. The sudden movement along a fault plane when accumulated tectonic stress exceeds friction — the rupture length and displacement determine the earthquake's magnitude.
Click on 'Seismic Wave Energy' — that's internal. The total energy radiated as seismic waves during an earthquake.
Click on 'Building Vulnerability' — that's internal. The susceptibility of structures to seismic damage based on construction materials.
Click on 'Ground Amplification' — that's internal. The degree to which local soil and geological conditions amplify or dampen incoming seismic waves — soft sediments can amplify shaking 2-10 times compared to solid bedrock.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Tectonic Stress is the external component because it is a geological force driven by plate tectonics that humans cannot influence or control — it builds independently of anything happening at the surface. Fault Slip, Seismic Wave Energy, Ground Amplification, and Building Vulnerability are internal because they represent the system's response chain: stress triggers slip, which releases waves, which are modified by local ground conditions, which interact with building characteristics to determine outcomes.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 5 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Tectonic Stress" and drag an arrow to "Fault Slip"
• Click on "Fault Slip" and drag an arrow to "Seismic Wave Energy"
• Click on "Seismic Wave Energy" and drag an arrow to "Ground Amplification"
• Click on "Ground Amplification" and drag an arrow to "Building Vulnerability"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Tectonic Stress → Fault Slip = POSITIVE (+)
    Greater accumulated tectonic stress produces larger fault slip when the rocks finally break. More stored energy means a longer rupture, greater displacement, and a higher magnitude earthquake.

  ○ Fault Slip → Seismic Wave Energy = POSITIVE (+)
    Larger fault slip releases more energy as seismic waves. A 1-meter slip produces moderate shaking; a 10-meter slip (like the 2011 Japan earthquake) releases catastrophic energy across vast distances.

  ○ Seismic Wave Energy → Ground Amplification = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger seismic waves traveling through soft sediments produce greater amplification effects. The interaction is multiplicative — double the wave energy in soil that amplifies 5x results in 10x the shaking compared to bedrock.

  ○ Ground Amplification → Building Vulnerability = POSITIVE (+)
    Greater ground amplification increases the seismic forces that buildings must withstand. Buildings designed for moderate shaking may survive on bedrock but fail catastrophically when ground amplification doubles or triples the effective shaking intensity.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 4 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 4 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If Tectonic Stress has been building for 100 years and suddenly releases, how do Fault Slip, Seismic Wave Energy, Ground Amplification, and Building Vulnerability interact to determine whether a city survives or is devastated?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Tectonic Stress' and drag an arrow
over to 'Fault Slip.'

Here's the key question: When tectonic stress goes UP, does
fault slip go UP or DOWN?

Greater accumulated tectonic stress produces larger fault slip when the rocks finally break. More stored energy means a longer rupture, greater displacement, and a higher magnitude earthquake.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Fault Slip' and drag an arrow
over to 'Seismic Wave Energy.'

Here's the key question: When fault slip goes UP, does
seismic wave energy go UP or DOWN?

Larger fault slip releases more energy as seismic waves. A 1-meter slip produces moderate shaking; a 10-meter slip (like the 2011 Japan earthquake) releases catastrophic energy across vast distances.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Seismic Wave Energy' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ground Amplification.'

Here's the key question: When seismic wave energy goes UP, does
ground amplification go UP or DOWN?

Stronger seismic waves traveling through soft sediments produce greater amplification effects. The interaction is multiplicative — double the wave energy in soil that amplifies 5x results in 10x the shaking compared to bedrock.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Ground Amplification' and drag an arrow
over to 'Building Vulnerability.'

Here's the key question: When ground amplification goes UP, does
building vulnerability go UP or DOWN?

Greater ground amplification increases the seismic forces that buildings must withstand. Buildings designed for moderate shaking may survive on bedrock but fail catastrophically when ground amplification doubles or triples the effective shaking intensity.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 4
positive relationships. 4 arrows total.

If Tectonic Stress has been building for 100 years and suddenly releases, how do Fault Slip, Seismic Wave Energy, Ground Amplification, and Building Vulnerability interact to determine whether a city survives or is devastated?

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Tectonic Stress is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — BEDROCK CITY
• Moderate earthquake, city built on solid bedrock with modern codes
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Building Vulnerability when seismic waves travel through solid bedrock?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — SOFT SOIL CITY
• Major earthquake, city built on soft sediment with older construction
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens when strong seismic waves encounter loose, water-saturated soil beneath a city?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — TWO CITIES COMPARISON
• Same earthquake affecting two cities with different ground and building conditions
• PREDICT FIRST: Why do you predict that two cities equidistant from the same earthquake will experience dramatically different levels of destruction?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Ground amplification is often more important than distance from the earthquake — soft soil can amplify shaking 2-10 times, meaning a city on clay can experience worse shaking than a closer city on bedrock
• Tectonic stress builds silently over decades to centuries, then releases in seconds — the longer the buildup, the more powerful the potential earthquake
• Building vulnerability varies enormously with construction quality — modern earthquake-resistant buildings can survive shaking that destroys unreinforced structures just blocks away
• The deadliest earthquakes aren't necessarily the strongest — a moderate earthquake in a vulnerable city can kill more people than a powerful earthquake in a prepared one

THE ANSWER: Two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience vastly different destruction because of two critical local factors: ground conditions and building quality. When seismic waves travel through solid bedrock, they pass through efficiently with relatively little amplification. But when those same waves enter soft, loose sediments — especially water-saturated clay or artificial fill — the ground amplifies the shaking 2 to 10 times. Meanwhile, buildings engineered with earthquake-resistant design flex and absorb energy, while older unreinforced structures crack and collapse. The earthquake's magnitude is just the starting point — what happens to the seismic energy at each specific location determines who lives and who dies.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Bedrock City. Moderate earthquake, city built on solid bedrock with modern codes.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Soft Soil City.
Major earthquake, city built on soft sediment with older construction.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens when strong seismic waves encounter loose, water-saturated soil beneath a city?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Two Cities Comparison. Same earthquake affecting two cities with different ground and building conditions.
Why do you predict that two cities equidistant from the same earthquake will experience dramatically different levels of destruction?

Here's what our model reveals: Two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience vastly different destruction because of two critical local factors: ground conditions and building quality. When seismic waves travel through solid bedrock, they pass through efficiently with relatively little amplification. But when those same waves enter soft, loose sediments — especially water-saturated clay or artificial fill — the ground amplifies the shaking 2 to 10 times. Meanwhile, buildings engineered with earthquake-resistant design flex and absorb energy, while older unreinforced structures crack and collapse. The earthquake's magnitude is just the starting point — what happens to the seismic energy at each specific location determines who lives and who dies.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Tectonic Stress?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Aftershock Frequency — The number and intensity of smaller earthquakes that follow a major event, which can collapse already-weakened structures and hamper rescue efforts for days to weeks after the mainshock
   • Tsunami Potential — The risk of ocean displacement when submarine earthquakes cause sudden vertical seafloor movement, generating tsunami waves that can travel across entire ocean basins at jet speed
   • Infrastructure Interdependency — The cascading failure of interconnected systems — a ruptured gas line causes fires, a broken water main prevents firefighting, downed power lines block roads — multiplying damage beyond direct seismic effects

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Tectonic Stress and Fault Mechanics — how does this connect to your model?
   • Seismic Wave Propagation — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is ground amplification often a bigger factor in earthquake destruction than the earthquake's magnitude?
   • What does your model reveal about why wealth and poverty determine earthquake survival as much as geology?
   • How does the timescale difference between stress buildup (centuries) and stress release (seconds) affect earthquake preparedness?
   • Why might a city that hasn't experienced an earthquake in a long time actually be at HIGHER risk?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 5 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Aftershock Frequency. The number and intensity of smaller earthquakes that follow a major event, which can collapse already-weakened structures and hamper rescue efforts for days to weeks after the mainshock
How would you model that?

Tsunami Potential. The risk of ocean displacement when submarine earthquakes cause sudden vertical seafloor movement, generating tsunami waves that can travel across entire ocean basins at jet speed
How would you model that?

Infrastructure Interdependency. The cascading failure of interconnected systems — a ruptured gas line causes fires, a broken water main prevents firefighting, downed power lines block roads — multiplying damage beyond direct seismic effects
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

### PowerPoint Slides

```
SLIDE 1: COVER
Visual: Title slide with aerial photo of contrasting earthquake damage
Say: "In 2010, Haiti had a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 230,000 people. Two months later, Chile had a magnitude 8.8 — that's 500 times more energy — and 525 people died. How is that possible?"
Do: Show the comparison on screen. Let the numbers sink in. Ask students what could possibly explain this.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 2: LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Visual: Learning goals and vocabulary terms
Say: "Today you're learning why earthquakes are only half the story — the ground you're standing on and the building you're in determine whether you live or die."
Do: Have students read objectives. Pre-teach 'ground amplification' and 'liquefaction.' Use the gelatin bowl analogy.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 3: BIG QUESTION
Visual: Two cities, same earthquake, different outcomes
Say: "Same earthquake, same distance. One city stands. One city falls. The earthquake didn't choose — the geology and engineering did."
Do: Show a map with two cities equidistant from a fault. Ask students to predict which would fare worse and why.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 4: LEVER FRAMEWORK
Visual: LEVER steps overview
Say: "We're building a model that starts deep underground where stress is building and follows the energy all the way up to the buildings above."
Do: Preview LEVER steps. Emphasize that this model spans scales from tectonic plates to individual buildings.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS
Visual: Component cards for earthquake model
Say: "Only one component is truly 'external' — the one we can't control. What is it, and why can't we control it?"
Do: Guide sorting: tectonic stress is external (geological force we can't influence). All other components are internal system responses. Discuss implications.
Time: 8 min

SLIDE 6: ACTIVITY 2: CONNECTIONS
Visual: Relationship arrows from tectonic stress to building damage
Say: "Stress builds for 100 years. It releases in 10 seconds. Then what happens to the energy between the fault and your school?"
Do: Help students trace the energy path: stress → slip → waves → amplification → damage. Identify where intervention is possible.
Time: 8 min

SLIDE 7: ACTIVITY 3: SIMULATION
Visual: Comparison graphs for bedrock vs. soft soil scenarios
Say: "Let's put two cities through the same earthquake and see which one survives. What's the difference?"
Do: Students predict outcomes. Run all three scenarios. Key discovery: ground amplification can matter more than earthquake magnitude.
Time: 10 min

SLIDE 8: DISCOVERIES
Visual: Key findings: amplification, vulnerability, preparedness
Say: "The deadliest earthquakes aren't the strongest. They're the ones that hit unprepared cities on bad soil. That's both terrifying and hopeful — because it means we CAN do something about it."
Do: Lead discussion on Haiti vs. Chile. Connect preparedness to equity: who builds on the worst soil? Usually the poorest communities.
Time: 5 min

SLIDE 9: STEM CHALLENGE
Visual: Earthquake risk assessment design challenge
Say: "Your city hasn't had a big earthquake in 120 years. That's not comforting — that means MORE stress has built up. Design a system that identifies who's most at risk."
Do: Groups create risk assessment maps and early warning systems. Must consider soil type, building quality, and community communication.
Time: 12 min

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Earthquakes Hit Some Cities Harder
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Earthquakes are among the most dramatic reminders that Earth's surface is not the stable, unchanging ground it appears to be. Beneath our feet, tectonic plates grind against each other at rates of centimeters per year, building enormous stress that is released in catastrophic bursts lasting seconds to minutes. But the earthquake itself is only half the story — what happens to seismic energy when it reaches the surface determines whether a city survives or collapses.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS2-1: Develop a model to illustrate how Earth's internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales to form continental and ocean-floor features.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model to illustrate how tectonic processes at depth interact with surface conditions to produce variable earthquake impacts across spatial scales.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large-Scale System Interactions
  Earth's internal processes (tectonic stress, fault mechanics) operate at temporal scales of centuries and spatial scales of thousands of kilometers, while surface effects (ground amplification, building response) operate at human timescales and local spatial scales.
• Crosscutting Concept: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
  Students analyze how earthquake phenomena span dramatically different scales: tectonic stress over centuries, fault slip in seconds, seismic waves over minutes, and ground amplification over meters — all interacting to determine outcomes.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Tectonic Stress, Seismic Waves, Ground Amplification, Liquefaction
□ Prepare Why do two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience completely different levels of destruction discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify tectonic stress, fault slip, seismic wave energy, building vulnerability, and ground amplification as the key components that determine earthquake impact.
• Establish: Students determine that tectonic stress drives fault slip, which generates seismic wave energy, which is then modified by ground amplification and interacts with building vulnerability to determine destruction levels.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing how geological processes at depth cascade through surface conditions to produce variable earthquake impacts across a city.
• Evaluate: Students run bedrock, soft soil, and two-city comparison scenarios to test their model and discover that local conditions often matter more than earthquake magnitude.
• Revise: Students add aftershock frequency, tsunami potential, or infrastructure interdependency to model more realistic post-earthquake cascading effects.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Tectonic Stress and Fault Mechanics:
  Earth's tectonic plates move at 1-15 cm per year, driven by mantle convection. Where plates meet, friction locks them together, and stress accumulates along the boundary. When stress exceeds the fault's frictional strength, the rocks suddenly snap past each other — releasing decades to centuries of stored energy in seconds. The San Andreas Fault, for example, has accumulated about 5 meters of 'slip deficit' since its last major rupture in 1906 — enough for a magnitude 7.8+ earthquake.

• Seismic Wave Propagation:
  An earthquake radiates three types of waves: P-waves (compressional, fastest, arrive first), S-waves (shear, slower, more damaging), and surface waves (slowest, most destructive). These waves travel through Earth's interior and along its surface at speeds of 3-8 km/s. As they encounter different rock and soil types, their behavior changes dramatically — they can be reflected, refracted, amplified, or dampened depending on the medium's density and elasticity.

• Ground Amplification: The Site Effect:
  This is the single most important factor in determining local earthquake damage. When seismic waves travel from dense bedrock into loose, soft sediments, conservation of energy forces the waves to slow down and increase in amplitude — like ocean waves growing taller as they approach the shore. Soft clay can amplify shaking 2-10 times compared to bedrock. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake killed 10,000 people largely because the city is built on an ancient lakebed that amplified seismic waves like a bowl of gelatin, even though the earthquake's epicenter was 350 km away.

• Building Vulnerability and Engineering:
  Modern earthquake engineering uses base isolation (buildings float on rubber bearings), moment-resisting frames (flexible steel that absorbs energy), shear walls (concrete cores that resist lateral forces), and tuned mass dampers (counterweights that reduce sway). The difference is stark: in the 2010 Chile earthquake, modern buildings designed to seismic codes suffered minimal damage while unreinforced masonry structures nearby were destroyed. Building codes save lives — but only if they exist, are enforced, and buildings are actually constructed to meet them.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Earthquakes kill people"
  Reality: Earthquakes don't kill people — buildings kill people. The ground shaking itself is rarely directly lethal. Casualties result from collapsing structures, falling debris, fires from ruptured gas lines, and tsunamis. In well-engineered cities, even powerful earthquakes cause few deaths. The 2010 Chile magnitude 8.8 earthquake killed 525 people because of strict building codes; the 2010 Haiti magnitude 7.0 killed 230,000 because of absent building codes.
  Strategy: Compare: Japan experiences thousands of earthquakes per year with very few casualties. What's different about their buildings?

• "All earthquakes produce the same type of shaking"
  Reality: Different earthquakes produce different frequency content depending on fault mechanics and depth. Smaller, shallow earthquakes produce high-frequency shaking that affects short, stiff buildings. Larger, deeper earthquakes produce low-frequency waves that cause tall buildings to sway dangerously. Ground conditions further modify the frequency content — soft soil amplifies low-frequency waves that are particularly damaging to mid-rise buildings.
  Strategy: Analogy: Shaking a bowl of gelatin slowly makes it sway gently; shaking it quickly makes it jiggle on the surface. Different frequencies affect different structures.

• "We can predict when earthquakes will happen"
  Reality: Despite decades of research, reliable short-term earthquake prediction remains impossible. We can identify WHERE earthquakes are likely (plate boundaries) and roughly HOW STRONG they might be (based on fault length and accumulated stress), but we cannot predict WHEN the fault will slip. The best approach is not prediction but preparation — building codes, early warning systems, and emergency plans that assume an earthquake can happen any time.
  Strategy: Analogy: We know a dam is under stress, but we can't predict the exact second it will break. So we build the town downstream to survive the flood.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience completely different levels of destruction?
Answer: Two cities the same distance from an earthquake experience vastly different destruction because of two critical local factors: ground conditions and building quality. When seismic waves travel through solid bedrock, they pass through efficiently with relatively little amplification. But when those same waves enter soft, loose sediments — especially water-saturated clay or artificial fill — the ground amplifies the shaking 2 to 10 times. Meanwhile, buildings engineered with earthquake-resistant design flex and absorb energy, while older unreinforced structures crack and collapse. The earthquake's magnitude is just the starting point — what happens to the seismic energy at each specific location determines who lives and who dies.

Simulation Answers:
• Bedrock City Scenario: When the earthquake occurs beneath a city built on solid bedrock with modern seismic building codes, Seismic Wave Energy travels through dense rock with minimal Ground Amplification (factor of ~1x). Building Vulnerability is low because structures are designed to flex and absorb seismic forces. Result: moderate shaking, minimal structural damage, few casualties. The model shows that the combination of good geology and good engineering dramatically reduces earthquake impact.
• Soft Soil City Scenario: When the same earthquake reaches a city built on soft, water-saturated sediment with older, unreinforced construction, Ground Amplification magnifies shaking by 3-10x. Building Vulnerability is high because structures were not designed for these forces. Result: severe shaking, widespread structural failure, potential liquefaction causing buildings to sink and tilt. The model reveals that local conditions can transform a survivable earthquake into a catastrophe.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does ground type matter more than magnitude?
  A: The model demonstrates that a magnitude 6.0 earthquake on soft clay can produce MORE actual shaking at the surface than a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on bedrock, because ground amplification multiplies the seismic energy by factors of 2-10x. Magnitude measures energy released at the SOURCE, but what matters for destruction is the shaking at the SURFACE. The ground acts as a filter that can either dampen or dramatically amplify the incoming waves. This is why seismic hazard maps focus on soil conditions, not just fault proximity.
• Q: Why does earthquake risk relate to poverty and equity?
  A: Historically, the cheapest land in earthquake-prone cities is on soft soil — former lakebeds, landfill, river deltas — because it's flat, easy to build on, and was considered less desirable. This means lower-income communities disproportionately occupy the most geologically vulnerable zones AND live in older, less earthquake-resistant buildings. The 2010 Haiti earthquake killed 230,000 people largely because Port-au-Prince was built on soft sediment with virtually no building codes, while wealthy nations facing similar seismic threats invest billions in retrofitting and engineering. Earthquake risk is a social justice issue as much as a geological one.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design an Earthquake Risk Assessment System
Mission: Design a risk assessment and early warning system that identifies the most vulnerable areas in a city and provides actionable information to emergency responders and residents before, during, and after an earthquake.
Scenario: Your city sits near an active fault zone that hasn't produced a major earthquake in 120 years — meaning enormous tectonic stress has accumulated. The city council has hired your team to create a seismic risk assessment that maps vulnerability across different neighborhoods based on soil type, building age, and proximity to the fault. Your system must identify which areas face the highest risk and recommend prioritized actions.
Introduction: Present the challenge: Your city sits on an active fault zone that hasn't ruptured in 120 years — meaning enormous stress has accumulated. The city council needs a seismic risk assessment system that identifies the most vulnerable neighborhoods and recommends a prioritized action plan. Your team must combine geological, structural, and socioeconomic data to create an actionable risk map.

Key Concepts:
• Seismic Microzonation: The process of dividing a city into zones based on expected ground response to earthquakes. Each zone is assigned an amplification factor based on soil type, depth to bedrock, and groundwater level. This determines building code requirements and informs land use planning.
• Earthquake Early Warning (EEW): Systems like ShakeAlert detect the initial P-waves from an earthquake and broadcast warnings before the more destructive S-waves and surface waves arrive. This provides seconds to tens of seconds of warning — enough to stop trains, open fire station doors, and trigger automated shutdown of gas lines and industrial processes.
• Seismic Retrofitting: Strengthening existing buildings to resist earthquake forces through techniques like adding steel bracing, base isolation, shear walls, or fiber-reinforced polymer wrapping. Retrofitting is expensive but far cheaper than rebuilding after destruction — and saves lives.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Risk assessment integrates soil data, building inventory, and socioeconomic vulnerability to create a detailed neighborhood-level risk map with prioritized retrofitting recommendations and early warning system design justified by model evidence
• Proficient (3): Risk assessment identifies high-risk zones based on geological and structural factors with reasonable recommendations for risk reduction
• Developing (2): Risk assessment addresses some vulnerability factors but lacks integration of geological and structural data or actionable recommendations
• Beginning (1): Risk assessment is incomplete or doesn't connect geological and structural vulnerability to earthquake outcomes

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified cross-section diagram showing how seismic waves behave differently in bedrock versus soft soil
  • Use a shake table demonstration or video: same structure on solid versus loose foundation shows amplification dramatically
  • Sentence frames: 'When tectonic stress is released as fault slip, seismic wave energy __ and when those waves reach soft soil, ground amplification __ causing building vulnerability to __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the seismic risk assessment for your own city or region — what fault lines are nearby, what type of soil is your school built on, and what building codes are in effect?
  • Investigate the 2011 Tohoku, Japan earthquake and tsunami: How did the seismic design of Japanese buildings perform, and why did the tsunami cause more damage than the shaking?
  • Design a shake table experiment that demonstrates ground amplification using gelatin (soft soil) versus a rigid platform (bedrock) with identical building models

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the energy difference between earthquake magnitudes using the logarithmic Richter scale: a magnitude 7.0 releases 31.6x more energy than a 6.0, and 1,000x more than a 5.0. Graph the exponential relationship.
  • ELA: Write a disaster preparedness communication plan for a city on a seismic fault: How do you inform residents about risk without causing panic, distrust, or apathy?
  • Social Studies: Research how earthquake preparedness correlates with national wealth: Compare building codes, emergency response, and death tolls between earthquakes in wealthy versus low-income nations. What does this reveal about structural inequality?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how tectonic stress accumulation and release produces seismic energy that interacts with local ground conditions
• Analyze how ground amplification and building quality create dramatically different outcomes from the same seismic event
• Predict which urban areas face the greatest earthquake risk based on geological and structural vulnerability factors

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Two neighborhoods are exactly 10 km from an earthquake epicenter. Neighborhood A is built on granite bedrock; Neighborhood B is built on water-saturated clay fill. According to your model, which will experience more intense shaking, and why?
• Constructed Response: The 2010 Haiti earthquake (magnitude 7.0) killed 230,000 people, while the 2010 Chile earthquake (magnitude 8.8 — nearly 500 times more energy) killed 525 people. Using your model, explain how two earthquakes of dramatically different power could produce such opposite death tolls.

SCENARIO: Your city sits near an active fault zone that hasn't produced a major earthquake in 120 years — meaning enormous tectonic stress has accumulated. The city council has hired your team to create a seismic risk assessment that maps vulnerability across different neighborhoods based on soil type, building age, and proximity to the fault. Your system must identify which areas face the highest risk and recommend prioritized actions.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How would you map the different soil and ground types across the city to identify amplification zones?
• What building characteristics would you survey to assess structural vulnerability?
• How would you communicate risk levels to residents without causing unnecessary panic?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What data sources would you use to map soil conditions, fault proximity, and building types across the city?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you create a risk scoring system that combines ground amplification potential with building vulnerability?

  _________________________________________________________

• What would your early warning system communicate, and how many seconds of warning would different zones receive?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you prioritize which buildings or neighborhoods need retrofitting first?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Risk assessment integrates soil data, building inventory, and socioeconomic vulnerability to create a detailed neighborhood-level risk map with prioritized retrofitting recommendations and early warning system design justified by model evidence
