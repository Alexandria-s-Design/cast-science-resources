### Title
**Why Do Athletes Collapse in the Heat? — Modeling Homeostasis and the Body's Breaking Point**

### Overview
The human body is a remarkable self-regulating machine. Every second, billions of biochemical reactions generate heat as a byproduct. The thermoregulatory system must continuously dissipate this heat to keep core temperature within a narrow safe range — typically 36.5–37.5°C. When this system fails, the consequences can be life-threatening. Students investigate the driving question: Why do some athletes collapse during games while others playing the same sport are fine? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 1: Foundations

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS1-3**: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that feedback mechanisms maintain homeostasis.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how the body uses feedback mechanisms to regulate core temperature during physical activity
- Explain how sweat rate, hydration, and exertion interact to maintain or disrupt homeostasis
- Predict the conditions under which an athlete's thermoregulation system will fail
- Analyze how external factors like hydration can shift the tipping point of heat-related illness

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Core Temperature | Internal | The internal temperature of the body, normally maintained around 37°C (98.6°F); rises with exertion and falls with cooling |
| Sweat Rate | Internal | The volume of sweat produced per hour by the body to cool itself through evaporative cooling |
| Hydration Level | External | The amount of available water in the body, which decreases as sweat is produced and must be replenished by drinking fluids |
| Physical Exertion | External | The intensity of physical activity, which generates metabolic heat and increases the body's demand for cooling |

WHY DO ATHLETES COLLAPSE IN THE HEAT?

Modeling Homeostasis and the Body's Breaking Point.
Why do some athletes collapse during games while others playing the same sport are fine?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Hydration Level" — the amount of available water in the body
  ○ Click "Physical Exertion" — the intensity of physical activity
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Core Temperature" — the internal temperature of the body
  ○ Click "Sweat Rate" — the volume of sweat produced per hour by the body to cool itself through evaporative cooling

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why do some athletes collapse during games while others playing the same sport are fine?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Core Temperature' — that's internal. The internal temperature of the body, normally maintained around 37°C (98.
Click on 'Sweat Rate' — that's internal. The volume of sweat produced per hour by the body to cool itself through evaporative cooling.
Click on 'Hydration Level' — that's external. The amount of available water in the body.
Click on 'Physical Exertion' — that's external. The intensity of physical activity.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Physical Exertion and Hydration Level are external components because they represent inputs that can be controlled or adjusted — an athlete chooses how hard to work and how much to drink. Core Temperature and Sweat Rate are internal because they are outputs of the body's thermoregulatory system that change in response to the external inputs.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Physical Exertion" and drag an arrow to "Core Temperature"
• Click on "Core Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Sweat Rate"
• Click on "Sweat Rate" and drag an arrow to "Hydration Level"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Physical Exertion → Core Temperature = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher physical exertion generates more metabolic heat, directly raising core temperature. Muscle contractions convert chemical energy to kinetic energy and heat.

  ○ Core Temperature → Sweat Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    As core temperature rises, the hypothalamus triggers increased sweat production to cool the body through evaporative cooling.

  ○ Sweat Rate → Hydration Level = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher sweat rate depletes the body's water reserves faster, decreasing hydration level. Without fluid replacement, the body loses its ability to cool itself.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Physical Exertion is high and Hydration Level drops, what happens to the body's ability to produce sweat and regulate Core Temperature? Where does the feedback loop break?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Physical Exertion' and drag an arrow
over to 'Core Temperature.'

Here's the key question: When physical exertion goes UP, does
core temperature go UP or DOWN?

Higher physical exertion generates more metabolic heat, directly raising core temperature. Muscle contractions convert chemical energy to kinetic energy and heat.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Core Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Sweat Rate.'

Here's the key question: When core temperature goes UP, does
sweat rate go UP or DOWN?

As core temperature rises, the hypothalamus triggers increased sweat production to cool the body through evaporative cooling.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Sweat Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Hydration Level.'

Here's the key question: When sweat rate goes UP, does
hydration level go UP or DOWN?

Higher sweat rate depletes the body's water reserves faster, decreasing hydration level. Without fluid replacement, the body loses its ability to cool itself.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When Physical Exertion is high and Hydration Level drops, what happens to the body's ability to produce sweat and regulate Core Temperature? Where does the feedback loop break?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Hydration Level is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — MODERATE & HYDRATED
• Moderate exertion, high hydration
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Core Temperature when the athlete is well-hydrated during moderate exercise?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — INTENSE & DEHYDRATED
• Maximum exertion, low hydration
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Sweat Rate when the body runs out of water during intense exercise?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — GRADUAL DEHYDRATION
• Steady exertion, declining hydration
• PREDICT FIRST: At what point do you predict the body's cooling system will fail?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The body's thermoregulation is a negative feedback loop — rising temperature triggers sweating, which cools the body back down
• Dehydration breaks the feedback loop because the body can't produce sweat without water, causing temperature to spike
• There's a critical tipping point where the cooling system fails — core temperature rises uncontrollably, leading to heat stroke
• Individual differences in fitness, acclimatization, and hydration habits explain why some athletes collapse while others don't

THE ANSWER: Athletes collapse when their body's negative feedback loop for temperature regulation breaks down. High exertion generates enormous heat, which normally triggers sweating to cool the body. But when hydration drops too low, the body can't produce enough sweat. Core temperature spirals upward past the tipping point, and the athlete's organs start shutting down — that's heat stroke.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Moderate & Hydrated. Moderate exertion, high hydration.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Intense & Dehydrated.
Maximum exertion, low hydration.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Sweat Rate when the body runs out of water during intense exercise?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Gradual Dehydration. Steady exertion, declining hydration.
At what point do you predict the body's cooling system will fail?

Here's what our model reveals: Athletes collapse when their body's negative feedback loop for temperature regulation breaks down. High exertion generates enormous heat, which normally triggers sweating to cool the body. But when hydration drops too low, the body can't produce enough sweat. Core temperature spirals upward past the tipping point, and the athlete's organs start shutting down — that's heat stroke.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Hydration Level?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Physical Exertion?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Ambient Temperature — The external air temperature and humidity, which affects how efficiently sweat can evaporate and cool the body
   • Blood Volume — The total volume of blood circulating in the body, which decreases with dehydration and reduces the body's ability to transport heat
   • Acclimatization Level — How adapted an athlete's body is to exercising in heat, which improves sweating efficiency and reduces strain

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Thermoregulation Basics — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Role of Hydration — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model demonstrate that homeostasis depends on negative feedback loops?
   • What happens in your model when the feedback loop is broken by dehydration?
   • Why might two athletes of the same fitness level respond differently to the same heat conditions?
   • How could coaches use your model to design safer practice schedules?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Ambient Temperature. The external air temperature and humidity, which affects how efficiently sweat can evaporate and cool the body
How would you model that?

Blood Volume. The total volume of blood circulating in the body, which decreases with dehydration and reduces the body's ability to transport heat
How would you model that?

Acclimatization Level. How adapted an athlete's body is to exercising in heat, which improves sweating efficiency and reduces strain
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Do Athletes Collapse in the Heat?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The human body is a remarkable self-regulating machine. Every second, billions of biochemical reactions generate heat as a byproduct. The thermoregulatory system must continuously dissipate this heat to keep core temperature within a narrow safe range — typically 36.5–37.5°C. When this system fails, the consequences can be life-threatening.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS1-3: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that feedback mechanisms maintain homeostasis.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Planning and Carrying Out Investigations
  Students plan investigations using their model to test how different combinations of exertion and hydration affect thermoregulation outcomes.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function
  Feedback mechanisms maintain the body's internal conditions within a range that supports life, including thermoregulation through sweating and blood vessel dilation.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students model how negative feedback maintains homeostatic stability and identify the conditions that push the system past its tipping point.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Homeostasis, Thermoregulation, Feedback Mechanism, Heat Exhaustion
□ Prepare Why do some athletes collapse during games while others playing the same sport are fine discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify core temperature, sweat rate, hydration level, and physical exertion as the key components of the body's thermoregulation system.
• Establish: Students determine that physical exertion increases core temperature, which increases sweat rate, which decreases hydration level — and that low hydration breaks the cooling loop.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing the negative feedback loop of thermoregulation and the conditions under which it fails.
• Evaluate: Students run moderate/hydrated, intense/dehydrated, and gradual dehydration scenarios to test their model and identify the tipping point.
• Revise: Students add ambient temperature, blood volume, or acclimatization level to explore more realistic thermoregulation dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Thermoregulation Basics:
  The hypothalamus acts as the body's thermostat, detecting blood temperature and triggering cooling responses. When core temperature rises, the hypothalamus signals sweat glands to produce sweat and blood vessels near the skin to dilate, increasing heat loss through evaporation and radiation. This is a classic negative feedback loop.

• The Role of Hydration:
  Sweat is about 99% water. An athlete can lose 1-2 liters of sweat per hour during intense exercise. When fluid loss exceeds intake, blood volume drops, making it harder for the cardiovascular system to transport heat from muscles to the skin surface. The body's cooling capacity diminishes rapidly with dehydration.

• Heat-Related Illness Spectrum:
  Heat illness exists on a continuum: heat cramps (muscle spasms from electrolyte loss), heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, weakness, nausea — body still attempting to cool), and heat stroke (core temp above 40°C, sweating stops, organ damage begins). Heat stroke is a medical emergency with a mortality rate of 10-50% if untreated.

• Individual Variation:
  Not all athletes respond to heat the same way. Factors include body composition, cardiovascular fitness, heat acclimatization (which takes 10-14 days of gradual exposure), hydration habits, medication use, sleep quality, and genetics. This explains why one player collapses while teammates seem fine.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Sweating means you're out of shape"
  Reality: Sweating is actually a sign of an efficient cooling system. Well-trained athletes often sweat MORE than untrained people because their bodies have adapted to dissipate heat more effectively. Less sweating during intense exercise can actually be a danger sign.
  Strategy: Compare: Who sweats more during the same workout — the marathoner or the couch potato? The marathoner, because their cooling system is better trained.

• "Drinking water when thirsty is enough"
  Reality: By the time you feel thirsty, you're already 1-2% dehydrated, which is enough to impair performance and thermoregulation. Thirst is a lagging indicator — the body needs water before the brain signals the sensation of thirst.
  Strategy: Try this thought experiment: If your car's temperature gauge only turned on after the engine was already overheating, would that be a good warning system?

• "Heat stroke only happens in extreme heat"
  Reality: Heat stroke can occur at surprisingly moderate temperatures when humidity is high, exertion is intense, or the athlete is dehydrated. Multiple cases have occurred at temperatures below 80°F. It's the combination of factors, not just air temperature, that matters.
  Strategy: Show cases of heat illness at 75°F with high humidity — ask students why temperature alone isn't a reliable predictor.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do some athletes collapse during games while others playing the same sport are fine?
Answer: Athletes collapse when their body's negative feedback loop for temperature regulation breaks down. High exertion generates enormous heat, which normally triggers sweating to cool the body. But when hydration drops too low, the body can't produce enough sweat. Core temperature spirals upward past the tipping point, and the athlete's organs start shutting down — that's heat stroke.

Simulation Answers:
• Moderate & Hydrated Scenario: When Physical Exertion is moderate and Hydration Level is high, Core Temperature rises slightly but the feedback loop works effectively. Sweat Rate increases to match heat production, Hydration Level decreases slowly, and Core Temperature stabilizes within the safe range. The system maintains homeostasis.
• Intense & Dehydrated Scenario: When Physical Exertion is at maximum and Hydration Level is low, the feedback loop breaks down. Core Temperature rises rapidly, Sweat Rate initially increases but then drops as the body runs out of water. With no evaporative cooling, Core Temperature spirals upward uncontrollably — this is the onset of heat stroke.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: How does the feedback loop break?
  A: The thermoregulation feedback loop breaks when hydration drops too low. Normally, rising core temperature triggers more sweating, which cools the body. But sweating requires water. When the body is dehydrated, it can't produce enough sweat, so temperature keeps rising with nothing to bring it back down. The negative feedback loop becomes a positive one — heat generates more heat.
• Q: Why do some athletes collapse while others don't?
  A: Individual variation in hydration habits, fitness level, heat acclimatization, and body composition means each athlete's tipping point is different. A well-hydrated, heat-acclimatized athlete can maintain homeostasis much longer than a dehydrated, unacclimatized one — even in identical conditions. The model shows that the threshold isn't the same for everyone.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Heat Safety Alert System
Mission: Design a wearable or sideline monitoring system that tracks athlete biometrics and alerts coaches before heat-related illness occurs.
Scenario: A high school athletic department has had three heat-related incidents in two years. The principal has hired your team to design a monitoring system that can predict when an athlete is approaching dangerous territory and alert the coaching staff before collapse occurs.
Introduction: Present the challenge: Your school's athletic department needs a system that prevents heat-related illness. Your team will design a monitoring solution that tracks key biometrics and alerts coaching staff before an athlete reaches dangerous territory.

Key Concepts:
• Biometric Monitoring: Wearable sensors can track heart rate, skin temperature, sweat rate, and motion in real time. These data streams can be combined with environmental data to estimate heat stress risk.
• Threshold Detection: Alert systems need carefully calibrated thresholds — too sensitive and coaches ignore constant false alarms, too lenient and athletes collapse before warnings trigger.
• Individual Baselines: Effective monitoring requires knowing each athlete's baseline values. A resting heart rate of 80 might be normal for one athlete but a sign of stress for another.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): System monitors multiple biometrics, uses individualized thresholds, provides graduated alerts, and includes evidence-based justification from model data
• Proficient (3): System monitors key biometrics and alerts coaches with reasonable thresholds based on model findings
• Developing (2): System monitors some indicators but thresholds are not well justified or alerts lack graduation
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or does not connect monitoring to the thermoregulation model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified diagram of the thermoregulation feedback loop for reference
  • Use colored arrows (red = positive, blue = negative) to help visualize feedback relationships
  • Sentence frames: 'When __ increases, __ responds by __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how military training programs prevent heat casualties and compare their protocols to your model
  • Investigate how humidity affects evaporative cooling and add an environmental factor to your model
  • Compare thermoregulation strategies in different organisms — how do dogs, elephants, and desert lizards cool themselves?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate fluid loss rates and determine optimal hydration schedules for different exercise intensities
  • ELA: Research and write a persuasive essay arguing for mandatory hydration protocols in high school athletics
  • Health/PE: Design a pre-season heat acclimatization protocol based on sports physiology research

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how negative feedback mechanisms maintain body temperature during exercise
• Investigate the relationship between hydration, sweat rate, and thermoregulation failure
• Predict conditions under which homeostasis breaks down using computational models

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: An athlete's core temperature rises during a game but returns to normal during halftime. Which feedback mechanism best explains this observation?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain why an athlete who is dehydrated is more likely to experience heat stroke than one who is well-hydrated, even if they are performing at the same intensity level.

___ Homeostasis                   
___ Thermoregulation              
___ Feedback Mechanism            
___ Heat Exhaustion               

A. The body's ability to maintain stable internal conditions — like temperature, blood sugar, and pH — even when the external environment changes
B. The biological process by which the body maintains its core temperature within a safe range, primarily through sweating and blood vessel dilation
C. A biological loop where the output of a system influences its own input — negative feedback stabilizes, positive feedback amplifies
D. A dangerous condition caused by the body's inability to cool itself, marked by heavy sweating, rapid pulse, dizziness, and potential organ damage

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Heat Safety Alert System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a wearable or sideline monitoring system that tracks athlete biometrics and alerts coaches before heat-related illness occurs.

SCENARIO: A high school athletic department has had three heat-related incidents in two years. The principal has hired your team to design a monitoring system that can predict when an athlete is approaching dangerous territory and alert the coaching staff before collapse occurs.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What biometric indicators would your system monitor in real time?
• How would you determine the threshold for triggering an alert?
• What role does individual variation play in setting safety limits?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What sensors would you need and where would they be placed on the athlete?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would the system communicate alerts to coaches during a game?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you account for differences in body size, fitness level, and acclimatization?

  _________________________________________________________

• What data would you display on the coach's dashboard?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): System monitors multiple biometrics, uses individualized thresholds, provides graduated alerts, and includes evidence-based justification from model data
• Proficient (3): System monitors key biometrics and alerts coaches with reasonable thresholds based on model findings
• Developing (2): System monitors some indicators but thresholds are not well justified or alerts lack graduation
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or does not connect monitoring to the thermoregulation model
