### Title
**Why Some People Can't Drink Milk — Gene Expression, Enzymes, and the Lactose Puzzle**

### Overview
Lactose intolerance is one of the most elegant examples of how a single gene controls a physical trait through enzyme production — and how human culture (dairy farming) drove genetic evolution in real time. Students investigate the driving question: Why can some people drink a milkshake with no problem while others suffer for hours? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 1: Foundations

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS3-1**: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain how genes code for enzyme production
- Model the relationship between lactase gene activity and lactose digestion
- Predict digestive outcomes based on gene expression levels
- Analyze why lactose tolerance varies across human populations

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Lactase Gene Activity | External | How actively the LCT gene is being expressed (read and translated into protein). In most humans, this decreases after childhood. |
| Lactase Enzyme Production | Internal | The amount of functional lactase enzyme present in the small intestine lining. Directly determined by gene expression level. |
| Lactose Breakdown | Internal | How effectively milk sugar (lactose) is split into absorbable sugars (glucose + galactose). Depends on available lactase enzyme. |
| Gut Bacteria Response | Internal | When undigested lactose reaches the large intestine, bacteria ferment it, producing gas (bloating, cramps) and drawing in water (diarrhea). |

WHY SOME PEOPLE CAN'T DRINK MILK

Gene Expression, Enzymes, and the Lactose Puzzle.
Why can some people drink a milkshake with no problem while others suffer for hours?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Lactase Gene Activity" — how actively the lct gene is being expressed (read and translated into protein)
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Lactase Enzyme Production" — the amount of functional lactase enzyme present in the small intestine lining
  ○ Click "Lactose Breakdown" — how effectively milk sugar (lactose) is split into absorbable sugars (glucose + galactose)
  ○ Click "Gut Bacteria Response" — when undigested lactose reaches the large intestine

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why can some people drink a milkshake with no problem while others suffer for hours?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Lactase Gene Activity' — that's external. How actively the LCT gene is being expressed (read and translated into protein).
Click on 'Lactase Enzyme Production' — that's internal. The amount of functional lactase enzyme present in the small intestine lining.
Click on 'Lactose Breakdown' — that's internal. How effectively milk sugar (lactose) is split into absorbable sugars (glucose + galactose).
Click on 'Gut Bacteria Response' — that's internal. When undigested lactose reaches the large intestine, bacteria ferment it, producing gas (bloating, cramps) and drawing in water (diarrhea).

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Lactase Gene Activity is external because it's determined by your genetics — you don't control which version of the gene you inherited. Lactase Enzyme Production, Lactose Breakdown, and Gut Bacteria Response are internal because they are all downstream consequences of gene expression level.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Lactase Gene Activity" and drag an arrow to "Lactase Enzyme Production"
• Click on "Lactase Enzyme Production" and drag an arrow to "Lactose Breakdown"
• Click on "Lactose Breakdown" and drag an arrow to "Gut Bacteria Response"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Lactase Gene Activity → Lactase Enzyme Production = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher gene expression means more mRNA is transcribed and translated into functional lactase protein. The gene is the blueprint; more reading = more enzyme.

  ○ Lactase Enzyme Production → Lactose Breakdown = POSITIVE (+)
    More enzyme molecules in the small intestine means more lactose molecules get broken down into absorbable glucose and galactose before reaching the large intestine.

  ○ Lactose Breakdown → Gut Bacteria Response = NEGATIVE (−)
    When more lactose is broken down in the small intestine, less undigested lactose reaches the large intestine bacteria. Higher breakdown means less fermentation and fewer symptoms.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: Every human baby can digest milk. Why would evolution 'turn off' this ability in most adults — and why did some populations keep it?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Lactase Gene Activity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Lactase Enzyme Production.'

Here's the key question: When lactase gene activity goes UP, does
lactase enzyme production go UP or DOWN?

Higher gene expression means more mRNA is transcribed and translated into functional lactase protein. The gene is the blueprint; more reading = more enzyme.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Lactase Enzyme Production' and drag an arrow
over to 'Lactose Breakdown.'

Here's the key question: When lactase enzyme production goes UP, does
lactose breakdown go UP or DOWN?

More enzyme molecules in the small intestine means more lactose molecules get broken down into absorbable glucose and galactose before reaching the large intestine.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Lactose Breakdown' and drag an arrow
over to 'Gut Bacteria Response.'

Here's the key question: When lactose breakdown goes UP, does
gut bacteria response go UP or DOWN?

When more lactose is broken down in the small intestine, less undigested lactose reaches the large intestine bacteria. Higher breakdown means less fermentation and fewer symptoms.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

Every human baby can digest milk. Why would evolution 'turn off' this ability in most adults — and why did some populations keep it?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Lactase Gene Activity is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — LACTOSE TOLERANT
• Lactase Gene Activity: HIGH
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: What happens to lactose breakdown and gut bacteria response when the gene is fully active?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — LACTOSE INTOLERANT
• Lactase Gene Activity: LOW
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: What happens to the undigested lactose, and why does it cause symptoms?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — PARTIAL TOLERANCE
• Lactase Gene Activity: MEDIUM
• PREDICT FIRST: Predict: Is there a threshold level of enzyme needed to avoid symptoms, or is it gradual?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Lactase gene activity directly controls enzyme production, which determines whether lactose gets digested or fermented
• Most humans naturally reduce lactase production after weaning — lactose TOLERANCE is actually the mutation, not intolerance
• There's a threshold effect: some lactase is enough to digest small amounts of dairy, but large amounts overwhelm limited enzyme
• Gut bacteria fermentation of undigested lactose produces gas and osmotic effects — this is what causes the symptoms

THE ANSWER: The difference comes down to a single gene. The LCT gene codes for lactase enzyme. In about 65% of humans worldwide, this gene gets 'turned down' after childhood (a process called lactase non-persistence). Without enough lactase, milk sugar passes undigested to the large intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. The ~35% who can drink milk as adults carry a mutation that keeps the LCT gene active — this mutation spread in populations that domesticated dairy animals about 7,500 years ago.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Lactose Tolerant. Lactase Gene Activity: HIGH.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Lactose Intolerant.
Lactase Gene Activity: LOW.

Before you run it — make a prediction. Predict: What happens to the undigested lactose, and why does it cause symptoms?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Partial Tolerance. Lactase Gene Activity: MEDIUM.
Predict: Is there a threshold level of enzyme needed to avoid symptoms, or is it gradual?

Here's what our model reveals: The difference comes down to a single gene. The LCT gene codes for lactase enzyme. In about 65% of humans worldwide, this gene gets 'turned down' after childhood (a process called lactase non-persistence). Without enough lactase, milk sugar passes undigested to the large intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. The ~35% who can drink milk as adults carry a mutation that keeps the LCT gene active — this mutation spread in populations that domesticated dairy animals about 7,500 years ago.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Lactase Gene Activity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Dairy Amount — The volume of lactose-containing food consumed. Small amounts may be tolerated even with low lactase, but large amounts overwhelm the system.
   • Gut Microbiome Composition — The specific bacteria species in your large intestine determine how aggressively undigested lactose is fermented and how severe symptoms are.
   • Epigenetic Regulation — Chemical modifications to DNA (methylation) that silence the lactase gene after weaning. This is the mechanism that 'turns off' lactase in most adults.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Lactase Gene (LCT) — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Lactase Persistence Mutation — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is lactose TOLERANCE the mutation, not lactose intolerance?
   • How does this example demonstrate the connection between DNA, proteins, and physical traits?
   • Why did the lactase persistence mutation spread in some populations but not others?
   • How does the threshold effect in your model relate to real-world dairy tolerance?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Dairy Amount. The volume of lactose-containing food consumed. Small amounts may be tolerated even with low lactase, but large amounts overwhelm the system.
How would you model that?

Gut Microbiome Composition. The specific bacteria species in your large intestine determine how aggressively undigested lactose is fermented and how severe symptoms are.
How would you model that?

Epigenetic Regulation. Chemical modifications to DNA (methylation) that silence the lactase gene after weaning. This is the mechanism that 'turns off' lactase in most adults.
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Some People Can't Drink Milk
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Lactose intolerance is one of the most elegant examples of how a single gene controls a physical trait through enzyme production — and how human culture (dairy farming) drove genetic evolution in real time.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS3-1: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• SEP: Asking Questions and Defining Problems
  Students ask questions about how DNA sequence variations lead to different enzyme production levels and downstream phenotypic differences across populations.
• DCI: LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits
  DNA codes for proteins (enzymes). Variations in gene regulation determine how much lactase enzyme is produced, directly causing the observable trait of lactose tolerance or intolerance. This is gene expression controlling phenotype.
• CCC: Cause and Effect
  A clear causal chain connects gene activity → enzyme production → substrate breakdown → symptom presence. Changing the initial cause (gene expression level) predictably changes the final effect (digestive outcome).

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Gene Expression, Lactase, Enzyme, Epigenetics
□ Prepare Why can some people drink a milkshake with no problem while others suffer for hours discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify lactase gene activity, enzyme production, lactose breakdown, and gut bacteria response as components.
• Establish: Students discover the causal chain: gene activity (+) enzyme → enzyme (+) breakdown → undigested lactose (+) bacteria response.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how gene expression level determines digestive outcomes.
• Evaluate: Students run tolerant, intolerant, and partial scenarios to discover threshold effects.
• Revise: Students add dairy amount, microbiome composition, or epigenetic regulation for more realistic modeling.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Lactase Gene (LCT):
  The LCT gene on chromosome 2 encodes the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, which sits on the brush border of small intestine epithelial cells. In all mammals, this gene is active during infancy (when the sole food is mother's milk) and naturally decreases in expression after weaning. This 'lactase non-persistence' is the ancestral, default human condition — NOT a disorder.

• The Lactase Persistence Mutation:
  About 7,500 years ago, a mutation arose upstream of the LCT gene that prevents the normal age-related decrease in expression. This mutation (specifically, a C-to-T change at position -13910) doesn't change the enzyme itself — it changes REGULATION, keeping the gene 'turned on' into adulthood. This mutation spread rapidly in populations that domesticated dairy cattle, providing a powerful selective advantage: access to a rich, reliable food source.

• Why Symptoms Occur:
  When lactose reaches the large intestine undigested, resident bacteria eagerly ferment it through anaerobic metabolism. This produces hydrogen gas, methane, and short-chain fatty acids. The gas causes bloating and cramps. Additionally, the undigested lactose is osmotically active — it draws water into the intestinal lumen through osmosis, causing diarrhea. The severity depends on how much lactose reaches the colon, which depends on how much lactase enzyme was available.

• Global Distribution:
  Lactase persistence follows dairy farming history almost perfectly. Northern European populations (90%+ tolerant), East African pastoralist groups like the Maasai and Tutsi (50-90% tolerant), and some Middle Eastern populations show high tolerance — all cultures with thousands of years of dairy tradition. East Asian, West African, Native American, and Aboriginal Australian populations show 70-100% intolerance — cultures without historical dairy farming. This is one of the clearest examples of gene-culture co-evolution.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Lactose intolerance is an allergy"
  Reality: Lactose intolerance is NOT an allergy. Allergies involve the immune system attacking a protein (like milk protein allergy, which is different and rarer). Lactose intolerance is a deficiency — not enough enzyme to break down a sugar. No immune response is involved. The distinction matters because allergies can be life-threatening (anaphylaxis) while lactose intolerance is uncomfortable but not dangerous.
  Strategy: Ask: What's the difference between being allergic to peanuts and being unable to digest beans? One involves your immune system; the other involves missing an enzyme.

• "Lactose intolerant people can't eat ANY dairy"
  Reality: Most lactose-intolerant people can handle some dairy. Aged cheeses (cheddar, parmesan) contain almost no lactose because bacteria consumed it during aging. Yogurt has 20-50% less lactose than milk for the same reason. Many intolerant people can tolerate a splash of milk in coffee. The threshold varies by individual.
  Strategy: Try the threshold experiment: Our model shows MEDIUM gene activity can handle small amounts. Most 'intolerant' people actually have SOME lactase — just not enough for a glass of milk.

• "Lactose intolerance is a modern disease"
  Reality: Lactose intolerance is the ancestral human condition — every human before 7,500 years ago was lactose intolerant as an adult. Tolerance is the modern mutation. We've medicalized the DEFAULT state and treated the mutation as normal, probably because medical science was developed primarily in Northern European populations where tolerance is common.
  Strategy: Show the evolutionary timeline: 200,000 years of human existence with intolerance; only 7,500 years with the tolerance mutation. Which is 'normal'?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why can some people drink a milkshake with no problem while others suffer for hours?
Answer: The difference comes down to a single gene. The LCT gene codes for lactase enzyme. In about 65% of humans worldwide, this gene gets 'turned down' after childhood (a process called lactase non-persistence). Without enough lactase, milk sugar passes undigested to the large intestine where bacteria ferment it, producing gas, bloating, cramps, and diarrhea. The ~35% who can drink milk as adults carry a mutation that keeps the LCT gene active — this mutation spread in populations that domesticated dairy animals about 7,500 years ago.

Simulation Answers:
• Lactose Tolerant Scenario: With HIGH Lactase Gene Activity, Enzyme Production is high, Lactose Breakdown is nearly complete, and Gut Bacteria Response is minimal — almost no undigested lactose reaches the colon. The person drinks milk with no symptoms because the causal chain handles the lactose before bacteria ever encounter it.
• Lactose Intolerant Scenario: With LOW Lactase Gene Activity, Enzyme Production drops to near zero, Lactose Breakdown is minimal, and most lactose passes intact to the large intestine where bacteria ferment it aggressively. Gut Bacteria Response is high — producing gas (bloating/cramps), drawing in water (diarrhea), and causing discomfort 30-120 minutes after dairy consumption.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is tolerance the mutation?
  A: All mammals stop producing lactase after weaning — it's an unnecessary energy expenditure once you stop nursing. The 'normal' state is lactase non-persistence. About 7,500 years ago, humans who domesticated cattle gained a massive survival advantage if they could digest milk as adults — a rich, reliable food source. A mutation that kept the lactase gene active was so advantageous that it spread through dairy-farming populations in just a few thousand years. Lactose tolerance is one of the fastest examples of natural selection in humans.
• Q: What does the threshold effect mean in real life?
  A: Our model shows that at MEDIUM gene activity, there's enough enzyme to handle small amounts of lactose but not large amounts. This matches reality: many lactose-intolerant people can eat a slice of cheese (low lactose) or a cup of yogurt (bacteria pre-digested the lactose) but can't drink a glass of milk. The threshold effect means intolerance isn't binary — it's about the RATIO of available enzyme to consumed lactose.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: The Dairy Product Design Challenge
Mission: Design a dairy product line that people with lactose intolerance can enjoy without symptoms, using your understanding of enzyme science.
Scenario: A food company wants to create a line of dairy products for the 65% of the world's population that is lactose intolerant. Using your model of lactase-lactose interactions, design products that solve the digestion problem through different scientific approaches.
Introduction: Frame this as a food science entrepreneurship challenge. The lactose-free market is worth over $15 billion globally and growing. Students are food scientists designing products for a massive underserved market.

Key Concepts:
• Enzymatic Pre-treatment: Adding microbial lactase enzyme directly to milk before packaging. The enzyme breaks down 99%+ of lactose during cold storage, producing sweeter-tasting milk (glucose and galactose taste sweeter than lactose).
• Bacterial Fermentation: Using Lactobacillus bacteria to ferment lactose in dairy products like yogurt and aged cheese. The bacteria consume lactose and produce lactic acid, naturally reducing lactose content by 20-80%.
• Enzyme Supplements: Lactase pills taken before dairy consumption. The challenge is timing — the enzyme needs to reach the small intestine simultaneously with the lactose, and stomach acid partially deactivates it.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design uses correct enzyme science, addresses specific lactose threshold levels, includes testing plan, and considers taste/texture/cost trade-offs
• Proficient (3): Design applies enzyme or fermentation principles correctly with reasonable product specifications
• Developing (2): Design addresses lactose removal but lacks scientific detail or testing plan
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't connect to gene expression / enzyme concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a pre-drawn diagram showing: Gene → mRNA → Protein (enzyme) → Chemical reaction → Products
  • Use a lock-and-key analogy for enzyme specificity: lactase is the ONLY key that opens the lactose lock
  • Sentence frames: 'When lactase gene activity is low, enzyme production __ which means lactose breakdown __ causing gut bacteria to __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research CRISPR possibilities: Could we theoretically 'turn on' the lactase gene in adults? What are the ethical implications?
  • Investigate the parallel evolution of lactase persistence: It evolved independently at least 5 times in different dairy cultures with different mutations
  • Compare the speed of lactase persistence evolution (7,500 years) to other human adaptations — why was this so fast?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate: If 65% of 8 billion people are lactose intolerant, and the average person would spend $50/year on lactose-free products, what's the total market size?
  • ELA: Write a persuasive product pitch for a lactose-free dairy company targeting an Asian market where 90% of the population is intolerant.
  • Social Studies: Research how dairy farming spread across Europe and Africa and how this cultural practice drove genetic change — a case study in gene-culture co-evolution.

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the causal relationship between gene expression and enzyme-mediated digestion
• Explain how DNA variations lead to observable phenotypic differences across populations
• Predict digestive outcomes based on genetic and environmental inputs

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Explain: Two siblings eat identical ice cream sundaes. One feels fine; the other has severe stomach cramps an hour later. Using your model, trace the causal chain from their LCT gene activity to their different outcomes.
• Analyze: About 90% of East Asian populations are lactose intolerant while 90% of Northern Europeans are tolerant. Using your understanding of gene expression and natural selection, explain this difference.

1. What is an enzyme and what does it do?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. What does it mean when a gene is 'expressed' or 'active'?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. Why do some people get stomach problems from drinking milk?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. How do genes determine physical traits like enzyme production?

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Gene Expression               
___ Lactase                       
___ Enzyme                        
___ Epigenetics                   

A. The process by which information from a gene is used to make a functional protein — when a gene is 'expressed,' it's actively being read and translated
B. The enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar) into glucose and galactose — without enough lactase, lactose passes undigested into the large intestine
C. A protein that speeds up a specific chemical reaction — lactase specifically catalyzes the breakdown of the lactose molecule
D. Changes in gene expression that don't alter the DNA sequence itself — the lactase gene gets 'turned down' after weaning in most humans

STEM CHALLENGE: The Dairy Product Design Challenge
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a dairy product line that people with lactose intolerance can enjoy without symptoms, using your understanding of enzyme science.

SCENARIO: A food company wants to create a line of dairy products for the 65% of the world's population that is lactose intolerant. Using your model of lactase-lactose interactions, design products that solve the digestion problem through different scientific approaches.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Can you add lactase enzyme to the product? How much and when?
• Could you pre-ferment the lactose using bacteria (like in yogurt)?
• What's the maximum amount of lactose an intolerant person can typically handle?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What scientific approach will your product use to solve the lactose problem?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you ensure the product still tastes and feels like dairy?

  _________________________________________________________

• What testing would you need to verify your product works for intolerant consumers?

  _________________________________________________________

• How does your solution compare to existing products like Lactaid?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design uses correct enzyme science, addresses specific lactose threshold levels, includes testing plan, and considers taste/texture/cost trade-offs
• Proficient (3): Design applies enzyme or fermentation principles correctly with reasonable product specifications
• Developing (2): Design addresses lactose removal but lacks scientific detail or testing plan
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't connect to gene expression / enzyme concepts
