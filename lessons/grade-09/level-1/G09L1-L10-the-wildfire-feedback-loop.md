### Title
**The Wildfire Feedback Loop — Modeling How Fire, Climate, and Ecosystems Create a Self-Reinforcing Cycle**

### Overview
Fire has been part of Earth's ecosystems for 400 million years — longer than flowering plants, longer than dinosaurs. Many ecosystems didn't just survive fire; they EVOLVED to need it. Pine cones that only open in extreme heat, grasses that regrow from underground roots, wildflowers that germinate in ash — fire is nature's reset button. But humans have disrupted this cycle in two devastating ways: a century of fire suppression that let fuel accumulate to explosive levels, and climate change that's drying out landscapes faster than they can recover. Students investigate the driving question: Why are wildfires getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop — and is the cycle feeding itself? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 1: Foundations

### NGSS Standard
**HS-ESS3-3, HS-LS2-6**: Create a computational simulation of a natural or designed system to test hypotheses about the functioning of natural systems. Evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions.

### Learning Objectives
- Model the positive feedback loop where wildfire destroys vegetation, reduces soil moisture, and creates conditions for more intense future fires
- Explain how fuel load, fire intensity, soil moisture, wind speed, and vegetation recovery interact in wildfire dynamics
- Predict how climate change is accelerating the wildfire feedback cycle by lengthening fire seasons and increasing fuel dryness
- Analyze why fire suppression policies have paradoxically made wildfires more dangerous

### Component List (Starting Model: 5 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Wind Speed | External | The velocity and consistency of air movement that delivers oxygen to the fire front, drives flame spread, carries embers to start spot fires ahead of the main front, and influences fire direction |
| Fuel Load | Internal | The quantity and condition of combustible vegetation and debris in the fire's path — determined by decades of growth, drought conditions, and whether previous fires or management have reduced it |
| Fire Intensity | Internal | The energy output and destructive power of the wildfire, determined by fuel availability, moisture content, wind, and topography — ranges from low-intensity surface fires to extreme crown fires that create their own weather |
| Soil Moisture | Internal | The water content of the ground, which regulates vegetation health, fuel dryness, and the fire's ability to penetrate into the organic soil layer — low soil moisture creates conditions for extreme fire behavior |
| Vegetation Recovery | Internal | The rate and extent to which plants regrow after a fire, restoring ground cover, stabilizing soil, and rebuilding the ecosystem — depends on fire intensity, soil condition, seed availability, and post-fire rainfall |

THE WILDFIRE FEEDBACK LOOP

Modeling How Fire, Climate, and Ecosystems Create a Self-Reinforcing Cycle.
Why are wildfires getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop — and is the cycle feeding itself?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Wind Speed" — the velocity and consistency of air movement that delivers oxygen to the fire front
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Fuel Load" — the quantity and condition of combustible vegetation and debris in the fire's path — determined by decades of growth
  ○ Click "Fire Intensity" — the energy output and destructive power of the wildfire
  ○ Click "Soil Moisture" — the water content of the ground
  ○ Click "Vegetation Recovery" — the rate and extent to which plants regrow after a fire

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 5 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Why are wildfires getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop — and is the cycle feeding itself?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Wind Speed' — that's external. The velocity and consistency of air movement that delivers oxygen to the fire front.
Click on 'Fuel Load' — that's internal. The quantity and condition of combustible vegetation and debris in the fire's path — determined by decades of growth.
Click on 'Fire Intensity' — that's internal. The energy output and destructive power of the wildfire.
Click on 'Soil Moisture' — that's internal. The water content of the ground.
Click on 'Vegetation Recovery' — that's internal. The rate and extent to which plants regrow after a fire.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Wind Speed is the external component because it is a meteorological variable driven by atmospheric conditions that humans cannot control during a wildfire event — it is a given that the system must respond to. Fuel Load, Fire Intensity, Soil Moisture, and Vegetation Recovery are internal because they are interconnected ecological variables that influence each other in a feedback loop: fire intensity depends on fuel and wind, fire destroys vegetation and dries soil, and vegetation recovery depends on soil moisture and fire severity.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 5 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Wind Speed" and drag an arrow to "Fire Intensity"
• Click on "Fuel Load" and drag an arrow to "Fire Intensity"
• Click on "Fire Intensity" and drag an arrow to "Soil Moisture"
• Click on "Soil Moisture" and drag an arrow to "Vegetation Recovery"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Wind Speed → Fire Intensity = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger winds deliver more oxygen to the fire front, increase flame length and spread rate, carry embers to start spot fires ahead of the main front, and can push a surface fire into tree crowns — transforming a manageable fire into an unstoppable inferno.

  ○ Fuel Load → Fire Intensity = POSITIVE (+)
    More available fuel — dry wood, leaves, brush, and dead trees — provides more combustible material for the fire to consume, releasing more energy and sustaining higher temperatures and faster spread rates.

  ○ Fire Intensity → Soil Moisture = NEGATIVE (−)
    Intense fires destroy the vegetation canopy that shades the ground, bake moisture out of the upper soil layers, and can create hydrophobic (water-repellent) compounds in the soil that prevent rainfall from absorbing, leading to rapid drying and erosion.

  ○ Soil Moisture → Vegetation Recovery = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher soil moisture supports faster seed germination, root development, and plant growth after a fire. Without adequate moisture, regeneration stalls and the burned landscape remains barren, exposed to erosion and further drying.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 4 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: After a major wildfire burns through a forest, how does the destruction affect Soil Moisture, Fuel Load for the next fire, and Vegetation Recovery? Where does the feedback loop either stabilize or spiral out of control?
```

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Wind Speed' and drag an arrow
over to 'Fire Intensity.'

Here's the key question: When wind speed goes UP, does
fire intensity go UP or DOWN?

Stronger winds deliver more oxygen to the fire front, increase flame length and spread rate, carry embers to start spot fires ahead of the main front, and can push a surface fire into tree crowns — transforming a manageable fire into an unstoppable inferno.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Fuel Load' and drag an arrow
over to 'Fire Intensity.'

Here's the key question: When fuel load goes UP, does
fire intensity go UP or DOWN?

More available fuel — dry wood, leaves, brush, and dead trees — provides more combustible material for the fire to consume, releasing more energy and sustaining higher temperatures and faster spread rates.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Fire Intensity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Soil Moisture.'

Here's the key question: When fire intensity goes UP, does
soil moisture go UP or DOWN?

Intense fires destroy the vegetation canopy that shades the ground, bake moisture out of the upper soil layers, and can create hydrophobic (water-repellent) compounds in the soil that prevent rainfall from absorbing, leading to rapid drying and erosion.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Soil Moisture' and drag an arrow
over to 'Vegetation Recovery.'

Here's the key question: When soil moisture goes UP, does
vegetation recovery go UP or DOWN?

Higher soil moisture supports faster seed germination, root development, and plant growth after a fire. Without adequate moisture, regeneration stalls and the burned landscape remains barren, exposed to erosion and further drying.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 3
positive relationships. 4 arrows total.

After a major wildfire burns through a forest, how does the destruction affect Soil Moisture, Fuel Load for the next fire, and Vegetation Recovery? Where does the feedback loop either stabilize or spiral out of control?

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Wind Speed is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — HEALTHY FIRE CYCLE
• Low wind, moderate fuel, adequate soil moisture
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen when a low-intensity fire moves through a forest with moderate fuel load and healthy soil moisture?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — CATASTROPHIC FIRE
• High wind, maximum fuel, drought conditions
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to fire intensity, soil moisture, and vegetation recovery when extreme conditions align?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — FEEDBACK LOOP TEST
• Track system behavior over multiple fire cycles
• PREDICT FIRST: After a catastrophic fire, do you predict the ecosystem will recover to its previous state, or will conditions worsen for the next fire?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Low-intensity fires are natural and beneficial — they clear fuel buildup, recycle nutrients, and promote biodiversity, keeping forests healthy and reducing the risk of catastrophic fires
• A positive feedback loop exists: intense fire destroys vegetation → less vegetation means less water retention → drier soil creates drier fuel → next fire burns hotter → even more vegetation destroyed
• Decades of fire suppression have created unnaturally high fuel loads in many forests, turning what should be low-intensity surface fires into catastrophic crown fires that destroy entire ecosystems
• Climate change is accelerating the feedback loop by raising temperatures, extending drought seasons, and reducing soil moisture — creating fire conditions that exceed the ecosystem's ability to recover

THE ANSWER: Wildfires are getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop because of a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop accelerated by climate change and a century of fire suppression. When a catastrophic fire burns through a forest, it destroys the vegetation that holds soil moisture. Without vegetation, the soil dries out faster, which stresses any regrowing plants and makes dead material more flammable. The next fire encounters drier, more abundant fuel and burns even hotter. Meanwhile, decades of fire suppression have allowed fuel to accumulate to unnaturally high levels, and climate change has made droughts longer and more intense. The system is feeding itself — each fire creates the conditions for a worse one.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Healthy Fire Cycle. Low wind, moderate fuel, adequate soil moisture.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Catastrophic Fire.
High wind, maximum fuel, drought conditions.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to fire intensity, soil moisture, and vegetation recovery when extreme conditions align?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Feedback Loop Test. Track system behavior over multiple fire cycles.
After a catastrophic fire, do you predict the ecosystem will recover to its previous state, or will conditions worsen for the next fire?

Here's what our model reveals: Wildfires are getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop because of a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop accelerated by climate change and a century of fire suppression. When a catastrophic fire burns through a forest, it destroys the vegetation that holds soil moisture. Without vegetation, the soil dries out faster, which stresses any regrowing plants and makes dead material more flammable. The next fire encounters drier, more abundant fuel and burns even hotter. Meanwhile, decades of fire suppression have allowed fuel to accumulate to unnaturally high levels, and climate change has made droughts longer and more intense. The system is feeding itself — each fire creates the conditions for a worse one.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Wind Speed?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Carbon Release — The massive amount of CO2 released when vegetation burns — a single large wildfire can release more carbon in weeks than the surrounding forest absorbed in decades, contributing to climate change that makes future fires worse
   • Fire Weather Index — A composite measure of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and drought that predicts fire danger — climate change is increasing the number of high fire-weather days per year in fire-prone regions
   • Pyrocumulonimbus Events — Extreme wildfires that generate their own thunderstorms, producing lightning that starts new fires and erratic winds that make the original fire unpredictable — a feedback loop within the feedback loop, representing the most dangerous fire behavior on Earth

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Natural Fire Cycle — how does this connect to your model?
   • Fire Suppression: A Century-Long Mistake — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does the positive feedback loop in your model explain why wildfires are getting progressively worse over time?
   • What does your model reveal about why a century of fire suppression has been counterproductive?

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 5 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

SLIDE 1: COVER
Visual: Title slide with dramatic wildfire image
Say: "In 2023, Canadian wildfires burned an area larger than Florida and turned New York City skies orange. In 2025, the LA fires destroyed over 12,000 structures. These aren't random events — they're part of a cycle that's feeding itself."
Do: Show the iconic orange sky photos from NYC and satellite imagery of Canadian fires. Let the scale sink in.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 2: LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Visual: Learning goals and vocabulary terms
Say: "Today we're modeling why wildfires are getting worse — and discovering that the solution isn't fighting fire harder. It's understanding the loop."
Do: Have students read objectives. Pre-teach 'fuel load' and 'positive feedback loop.' Ask who's been affected by wildfire smoke.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 3: BIG QUESTION
Visual: Why are wildfires getting bigger and harder to stop?
Say: "Here's the paradox: we've spent a century putting out fires, and fires have gotten WORSE. How is that possible?"
Do: Quick-write: Students brainstorm why fighting fire might make fire worse. Pair-share. Introduce the concept of unintended consequences.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 4: LEVER FRAMEWORK
Visual: LEVER steps overview
Say: "We're going to model the wildfire feedback loop and find out: is there a way to break the cycle, or is it already running away from us?"
Do: Preview LEVER steps. Emphasize that this model includes a FEEDBACK LOOP — the output becomes the next input.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS
Visual: Component cards for wildfire model
Say: "Wind is the one thing we absolutely cannot control in a wildfire. Everything else is part of the system that feeds or fights the fire. Sort them."

Say: "Let's run three futures: a healthy forest with natural fire, a catastrophic fire, and the aftermath. Does the ecosystem bounce back or spiral down?"
Do: Students predict outcomes. Run scenarios over multiple fire cycles. Key discovery: the feedback loop — each fire makes the next one worse.
Time: 10 min

SLIDE 8: DISCOVERIES
Visual: Key findings: feedback loop, fire suppression backfire, climate acceleration
Say: "Fire isn't the enemy. The ABSENCE of fire — for a century — created an enemy we may not be able to stop. The solution isn't more firefighting. It's more FIRE — the right kind, at the right time."
Do: Discuss the paradox: fighting fire made things worse. Indigenous fire management used controlled burns for thousands of years. Connect to climate change amplification.
Time: 5 min

SLIDE 9: STEM CHALLENGE

TEACHER GUIDE: The Wildfire Feedback Loop
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Fire has been part of Earth's ecosystems for 400 million years — longer than flowering plants, longer than dinosaurs. Many ecosystems didn't just survive fire; they EVOLVED to need it. Pine cones that only open in extreme heat, grasses that regrow from underground roots, wildflowers that germinate in ash — fire is nature's reset button. But humans have disrupted this cycle in two devastating ways: a century of fire suppression that let fuel accumulate to explosive levels, and climate change that's drying out landscapes faster than they can recover.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS3-3, HS-LS2-6: Create a computational simulation of a natural or designed system to test hypotheses about the functioning of natural systems. Evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
  Students create computational simulations that model fire behavior, track changes over multiple fire cycles, and test hypotheses about how feedback loops maintain or destabilize ecosystem conditions.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems / LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
  Students model how human activities (fire suppression, climate change, development) alter natural fire regimes, and how complex interactions in fire-adapted ecosystems are disrupted when the natural cycle is broken.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students analyze how fire-adapted ecosystems maintain stability through periodic low-intensity disturbance, and how disruption of this cycle — through suppression, climate change, or development — pushes the system toward catastrophic, self-reinforcing change.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Fuel Load, Fire Intensity, Soil Moisture, Positive Feedback Loop
□ Prepare Why are wildfires getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop — and is the cycle feeding itself discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify wind speed, fuel load, fire intensity, soil moisture, and vegetation recovery as the key components that determine wildfire behavior and ecosystem recovery.
• Establish: Students determine that wind speed drives fire intensity when fuel is available, fire intensity reduces soil moisture and destroys vegetation, and slow vegetation recovery leaves fuel and dry conditions for the next fire — forming a positive feedback loop.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing the positive feedback loop where each fire cycle creates conditions for more intense future fires, and where disruption points could break the cycle.
• Evaluate: Students run healthy fire, catastrophic fire, and post-fire recovery scenarios to test their model and discover whether the ecosystem recovers or enters a self-reinforcing destructive cycle.
• Revise: Students add carbon release, fire weather index, or pyrocumulonimbus events to model more realistic wildfire dynamics and climate feedback.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Natural Fire Cycle:
  In a healthy fire-adapted ecosystem, low-intensity surface fires sweep through every 5-30 years, burning dead leaves, fallen branches, and small shrubs while leaving mature trees largely unharmed. These fires recycle nutrients back to the soil, create openings for new growth, kill disease-causing organisms, and prevent fuel from accumulating to dangerous levels. Many species depend on fire: longleaf pine forests, tallgrass prairies, and Australian eucalyptus woodlands all evolved with regular burning. Without fire, these ecosystems slowly degrade.

• Fire Suppression: A Century-Long Mistake:
  After the Great Fires of 1910 burned 3 million acres and killed 85 firefighters in the American West, the U.S. adopted a policy of suppressing ALL wildfires as quickly as possible. For a century, this seemed to work — fire acreage dropped dramatically. But fuel loads skyrocketed. Forests that naturally burned every 10-15 years accumulated 50-100 years of dead wood, brush, and dense undergrowth. What would have been a mild surface fire in 1920 is now a catastrophic crown fire in 2025 because there's 10 times more fuel.

• Climate Change: Adding Fuel to the Fire:
  Climate change is supercharging the wildfire problem through multiple mechanisms: higher average temperatures dry out vegetation faster, snowpack melts earlier reducing summer soil moisture, drought periods are longer and more severe, and the fire season has extended by 80+ days in the western U.S. since 1970. The result: fire weather conditions that would have been extreme are now routine. The 2020 U.S. fire season burned 10.1 million acres. The 2023 Canadian wildfires burned 45 million acres — an area larger than Florida.

• The Positive Feedback Loop:
  Here's where the science gets frightening: wildfire itself creates conditions for worse future fires. A catastrophic fire destroys the tree canopy that shades the ground → without shade, soil temperatures rise and moisture evaporates → drier soil can't support rapid revegetation → the burned area accumulates dead, dry material as fuel → the next fire has abundant dry fuel and burns even hotter. Meanwhile, massive fires release stored carbon as CO2 → more CO2 accelerates climate change → climate change creates hotter, drier conditions → which make fires worse. The loop feeds itself at every level.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "All wildfire is destructive and should be prevented"
  Reality: Many ecosystems REQUIRE fire to remain healthy. Longleaf pine forests, tallgrass prairies, chaparral, and Australian eucalyptus woodlands all evolved with regular fire and decline without it. Low-intensity surface fires recycle nutrients, reduce disease, promote biodiversity, and prevent catastrophic fuel accumulation. The problem isn't fire itself — it's the wrong KIND of fire at the wrong TIME, which results from decades of suppression.
  Strategy: Show comparison: A longleaf pine forest burned every 3 years (open, park-like, diverse understory) versus one unburned for 30 years (choked with brush, diseased trees, catastrophic fire risk). Which is healthier?

• "Climate change is the only reason wildfires are getting worse"
  Reality: Climate change is a major accelerant, but it's not the whole story. A century of fire suppression has loaded forests with 5-10 times more fuel than they would naturally carry. Development in the wildland-urban interface has put millions of homes in fire's path. And the loss of Indigenous cultural burning practices removed a management tool that maintained healthy landscapes for millennia. The wildfire crisis is the result of MULTIPLE human decisions compounding over time.
  Strategy: Thought experiment: If climate change magically reversed tomorrow, would forests with 80 years of accumulated fuel suddenly become safe? What else needs to change?

• "Bigger firefighting budgets will solve the wildfire problem"
  Reality: The U.S. spends over $3 billion per year on wildfire suppression, and fires are still getting worse. Suppression treats the symptom (active fire) without addressing the cause (excessive fuel, dry conditions, climate change). Worse, every dollar spent on suppression is a dollar NOT spent on prevention — prescribed burns, fuel reduction, and building codes. The model shows that breaking the feedback loop BEFORE a fire starts is exponentially more effective than fighting it once it's burning.
  Strategy: Analogy: If your house flooded every year because of a broken pipe, would you buy bigger mops or fix the pipe? Fire suppression is the mop; prescribed burns and fuel management are the pipe fix.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why are wildfires getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop — and is the cycle feeding itself?
Answer: Wildfires are getting bigger, hotter, and harder to stop because of a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop accelerated by climate change and a century of fire suppression. When a catastrophic fire burns through a forest, it destroys the vegetation that holds soil moisture. Without vegetation, the soil dries out faster, which stresses any regrowing plants and makes dead material more flammable. The next fire encounters drier, more abundant fuel and burns even hotter. Meanwhile, decades of fire suppression have allowed fuel to accumulate to unnaturally high levels, and climate change has made droughts longer and more intense. The system is feeding itself — each fire creates the conditions for a worse one.

Simulation Answers:
• Healthy Fire Scenario: When Wind Speed is low and Fuel Load is moderate with adequate Soil Moisture, Fire Intensity remains low. The surface fire clears accumulated brush and dead material without killing mature trees. Soil Moisture is minimally affected because the canopy survives. Vegetation Recovery is rapid because root systems remain intact and soil conditions support regrowth. The model shows that low-intensity fire is a stabilizing force — it REDUCES fuel load, preventing the conditions for catastrophic fire.
• Catastrophic Fire Scenario: When Wind Speed is high, Fuel Load is at maximum (80 years of accumulation), and Soil Moisture is low from drought, Fire Intensity reaches extreme levels. Crown fire destroys the entire canopy and bakes the soil. Soil Moisture drops to near zero. Vegetation Recovery is extremely slow because root systems are killed, seed banks are destroyed, and the soil is hydrophobic. The model reveals the feedback loop: the burned landscape accumulates new fuel faster than it recovers canopy, making the next fire just as intense — or worse.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why did a century of fire suppression backfire?
  A: The model clearly shows why: by preventing low-intensity fires for 80-100 years, fire suppression allowed Fuel Load to accumulate to levels far beyond what would naturally exist. In a healthy fire regime, periodic burns keep fuel at moderate levels — like regularly emptying a trash can. Suppression is like never emptying the trash for a decade and then being surprised when it catches fire and burns down the house. The model demonstrates that removing periodic disturbance from a system that evolved with it doesn't create stability — it creates a bomb.
• Q: How does climate change accelerate the feedback loop?
  A: Climate change attacks the wildfire feedback loop at multiple points simultaneously. Higher temperatures reduce Soil Moisture, which stresses vegetation and makes Fuel Load drier and more ignitable. Extended drought periods prevent Vegetation Recovery between fires, leaving more bare ground that dries further. Warmer winters mean more insects that kill trees, adding to Fuel Load. And earlier snowmelt extends the fire season by 80+ days. The model shows that climate change doesn't just make individual fires worse — it accelerates the entire feedback cycle so that each successive fire occurs in progressively more extreme conditions.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Community Wildfire Resilience Plan
Mission: Design a comprehensive wildfire management plan for a community in the wildland-urban interface that breaks the feedback loop through prevention, preparation, and ecosystem restoration.
Scenario: A mountain community of 15,000 people borders a national forest that hasn't experienced a major fire in 80 years. Fuel loads are at record levels, drought conditions are worsening, and the forest is surrounded by new housing developments. The community has hired your team to design a wildfire resilience plan that addresses both immediate safety and long-term ecosystem health. Your plan must balance fire prevention with the ecological need for fire.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A mountain community of 15,000 residents borders a national forest with 80 years of accumulated fuel. Drought conditions are worsening, and development is expanding into the wildland-urban interface. The community council needs a comprehensive wildfire resilience plan that addresses immediate safety, long-term forest health, and the feedback loop that's making both worse.

Key Concepts:
• Prescribed Burns and Fuel Management: Intentionally set, carefully controlled low-intensity fires that reduce accumulated fuel loads to historically natural levels. Prescribed burns mimic the natural fire cycle that maintained forest health for millennia. Indigenous peoples across the Americas, Australia, and Africa practiced cultural burning for thousands of years before European fire suppression policies disrupted these practices.
• Defensible Space and Fire-Adapted Communities: A zone around structures where vegetation is managed to reduce fire intensity and give firefighters a chance to defend the building. Zone 1 (0-5 feet): No combustible material. Zone 2 (5-30 feet): Low, well-spaced, fire-resistant plants. Zone 3 (30-100 feet): Reduced and spaced fuel. Combined with fire-resistant building materials (metal roofs, tempered glass, non-combustible siding), defensible space dramatically increases structure survival.
• Post-Fire Ecosystem Restoration: Active management to help fire-damaged ecosystems recover before the feedback loop takes hold. Strategies include erosion control (mulching, wattles), reseeding with native species, salvaging usable timber while leaving some dead wood for habitat, and controlling invasive species that colonize burned areas. The goal is to restore vegetation cover fast enough to stabilize soil moisture before the next fire season.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses the feedback loop at multiple intervention points, includes prescribed burn schedule, defensible space standards, early warning system, and post-fire restoration strategy, all justified with evidence from the computational model
• Proficient (3): Plan addresses wildfire prevention and community safety with reasonable strategies based on model findings
• Developing (2): Plan addresses some wildfire risks but doesn't connect strategies to the feedback loop or lacks comprehensive approach
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or relies solely on traditional fire suppression without addressing the underlying feedback cycle

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a diagram of the wildfire feedback loop with labeled intervention points where the cycle could be broken
  • Use before/after images of prescribed burns: show how managed fire creates a park-like forest that resists catastrophic fire
  • Sentence frames: 'When fire intensity is high, soil moisture __ because __, which means vegetation recovery __ because __, creating conditions where the next fire __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how Indigenous fire management practices (Aboriginal Australian fire-stick farming, Native American cultural burns) maintained healthy landscapes for thousands of years, and how these practices are being revived today
  • Investigate pyrocumulonimbus events — fires so large they create their own thunderstorms — and model how this represents a feedback loop within the feedback loop
  • Analyze satellite data showing how fire scars from major wildfires (Paradise, CA 2018; Black Summer Australia 2019-20) are recovering — is the vegetation returning, or is the feedback loop taking hold?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate fuel accumulation rates: If a forest produces 2 tons/hectare/year of dead material and fire normally removes it every 15 years, how much fuel accumulates after 80 years of suppression? Graph the exponential risk increase.
  • ELA: Write a policy brief for the state legislature arguing for increased funding for prescribed burns, using evidence from your model to demonstrate that fire prevention is more cost-effective than firefighting
  • Social Studies: Research how wildfire risk intersects with housing affordability: Why do people build in fire-prone areas, what role do insurance markets play, and who bears the cost when fires destroy communities?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the positive feedback loop between wildfire, vegetation loss, soil moisture, and fuel accumulation
• Analyze how human fire suppression policies and climate change have disrupted the natural fire cycle
• Create computational simulations to predict future fire behavior under different management and climate scenarios

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Analyze: A national forest has not burned in 80 years due to aggressive fire suppression. Using your model, explain why this forest is now at HIGHER risk of catastrophic fire than one that experienced periodic low-intensity burns. Identify every component affected by the long suppression period.
• Evaluate: A forest manager proposes two strategies: (A) Continue fire suppression and invest in firefighting technology, or (B) Implement a prescribed burn program that intentionally sets low-intensity fires. Using evidence from your model, evaluate which strategy is more likely to prevent catastrophic wildfire in the long term.
