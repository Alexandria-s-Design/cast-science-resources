### Title
**Fast Fashion Is Killing the Planet — Modeling the Environmental Cost of Cheap Clothing**

### Overview
The fashion industry has quietly become one of the most destructive industries on Earth. While we obsess over oil companies and car emissions, the clothes on your back account for 10% of global carbon emissions, consume 79 trillion liters of water annually, and generate 92 million tons of waste per year. And it's accelerating — clothing production has doubled since 2000. Students investigate the driving question: How does a $5 T-shirt end up costing the planet so much? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### NGSS Standard
**HS-ESS3-4, HS-ETS1-3**: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems. Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how consumer demand for cheap clothing drives a cycle of overproduction, waste, and environmental destruction
- Explain the relationships between production rate, textile waste, water consumption, and carbon emissions in the fashion industry
- Predict the environmental consequences of current fast fashion trends continuing over the next decade
- Evaluate technological and behavioral solutions that could reduce the fashion industry's environmental footprint

### Component List (Starting Model: 5 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Consumer Demand | External | The volume and frequency of clothing purchases driven by trends, low prices, social media marketing, and the perceived need for new outfits — the average consumer buys 68 garments per year |
| Production Rate | Internal | The speed and volume at which clothing manufacturers produce garments, driven by consumer demand and the pressure to deliver new styles weekly at the lowest possible cost |
| Textile Waste | Internal | The amount of discarded clothing, fabric scraps from manufacturing, and unsold inventory that ends up in landfills, is incinerated, or is exported to developing nations |
| Water Consumption | Internal | The total freshwater used in growing cotton, dyeing fabric, washing textiles, and finishing garments throughout the supply chain |
| Carbon Emissions | Internal | The total greenhouse gases released from manufacturing processes, global shipping, synthetic fiber production from petroleum, and decomposition of textile waste in landfills |

FAST FASHION IS KILLING THE PLANET

Modeling the Environmental Cost of Cheap Clothing.
How does a $5 T-shirt end up costing the planet so much?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Consumer Demand" — the volume and frequency of clothing purchases driven by trends
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Production Rate" — the speed and volume at which clothing manufacturers produce garments
  ○ Click "Textile Waste" — the amount of discarded clothing
  ○ Click "Water Consumption" — the total freshwater used in growing cotton
  ○ Click "Carbon Emissions" — the total greenhouse gases released from manufacturing processes

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 5 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"How does a $5 T-shirt end up costing the planet so much?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Consumer Demand' — that's external. The volume and frequency of clothing purchases driven by trends.
Click on 'Production Rate' — that's internal. The speed and volume at which clothing manufacturers produce garments.
Click on 'Textile Waste' — that's internal. The amount of discarded clothing.
Click on 'Water Consumption' — that's internal. The total freshwater used in growing cotton.
Click on 'Carbon Emissions' — that's internal. The total greenhouse gases released from manufacturing processes.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Consumer Demand is the external component because it represents the input that drives the entire system — purchasing decisions are made by consumers and can be consciously changed. Production Rate, Textile Waste, Water Consumption, and Carbon Emissions are internal because they are system responses that increase or decrease as a direct consequence of changes in consumer demand.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 5 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Consumer Demand" and drag an arrow to "Production Rate"
• Click on "Production Rate" and drag an arrow to "Textile Waste"
• Click on "Production Rate" and drag an arrow to "Water Consumption"
• Click on "Production Rate" and drag an arrow to "Carbon Emissions"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Consumer Demand → Production Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher consumer demand signals manufacturers to increase production speed and volume. Fast fashion brands use real-time sales data and social media trends to ramp up production of popular styles within days.

  ○ Production Rate → Textile Waste = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher production rates generate more manufacturing waste (fabric scraps, defective items, overstock) and more consumer waste as garments are treated as disposable. Approximately 12% of fabric is wasted during cutting alone.

  ○ Production Rate → Water Consumption = POSITIVE (+)
    More garments produced means more cotton grown (irrigated), more fabric dyed (water-intensive), and more textiles washed and finished. Water consumption scales almost linearly with production volume.

  ○ Production Rate → Carbon Emissions = POSITIVE (+)
    Increased production requires more energy for manufacturing, more petroleum for synthetic fibers, more fuel for global shipping, and generates more landfill methane from unsold and discarded garments.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 4 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 4 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Consumer Demand increases because of a new social media trend, what chain reaction does it trigger through Production Rate, and how does that amplify Textile Waste, Water Consumption, and Carbon Emissions simultaneously?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Consumer Demand' and drag an arrow
over to 'Production Rate.'

Here's the key question: When consumer demand goes UP, does
production rate go UP or DOWN?

Higher consumer demand signals manufacturers to increase production speed and volume. Fast fashion brands use real-time sales data and social media trends to ramp up production of popular styles within days.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Production Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Textile Waste.'

Here's the key question: When production rate goes UP, does
textile waste go UP or DOWN?

Higher production rates generate more manufacturing waste (fabric scraps, defective items, overstock) and more consumer waste as garments are treated as disposable. Approximately 12% of fabric is wasted during cutting alone.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Production Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Water Consumption.'

Here's the key question: When production rate goes UP, does
water consumption go UP or DOWN?

More garments produced means more cotton grown (irrigated), more fabric dyed (water-intensive), and more textiles washed and finished. Water consumption scales almost linearly with production volume.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Production Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Carbon Emissions.'

Here's the key question: When production rate goes UP, does
carbon emissions go UP or DOWN?

Increased production requires more energy for manufacturing, more petroleum for synthetic fibers, more fuel for global shipping, and generates more landfill methane from unsold and discarded garments.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 4
positive relationships. 4 arrows total.

When Consumer Demand increases because of a new social media trend, what chain reaction does it trigger through Production Rate, and how does that amplify Textile Waste, Water Consumption, and Carbon Emissions simultaneously?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Consumer Demand is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — BUSINESS AS USUAL
• Consumer Demand at current high levels
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to textile waste and carbon emissions if shopping habits stay exactly the same for the next 10 years?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — BUY LESS MOVEMENT
• Consumer Demand reduced by 50%
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the entire supply chain when people buy half as many clothes?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — CIRCULAR FASHION
• High demand but with recycling and reuse systems
• PREDICT FIRST: Can technology and recycling offset the environmental impact of high consumer demand?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Consumer demand is the primary driver — every additional garment purchased triggers water consumption, carbon emissions, and eventual textile waste in a one-directional cascade
• The fast fashion system produces environmental damage at every stage: growing raw materials (water), manufacturing (carbon), shipping (carbon), wearing (microplastics), and disposal (landfill waste)
• Reducing demand has a larger environmental impact than improving recycling, because most environmental damage occurs during production, not disposal
• The fashion industry's environmental impact is hidden from consumers — the true cost of a $5 T-shirt includes 2,700 liters of water, 7 kg of CO2, and eventual landfill space for 200+ years

THE ANSWER: A $5 T-shirt costs the planet enormously because the price tag hides the true environmental cost. Consumer demand for cheap, trendy clothing drives manufacturers to produce at breakneck speed using enormous quantities of water (2,700 liters per shirt), generating massive carbon emissions (10% of global total), and creating 92 million tons of textile waste annually. The model reveals a one-directional cascade: consumer demand drives production rate, which simultaneously increases water consumption, carbon emissions, and textile waste. The system is designed to be disposable — and the planet pays the hidden price.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Business as Usual. Consumer Demand at current high levels.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Buy Less Movement.
Consumer Demand reduced by 50%.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to the entire supply chain when people buy half as many clothes?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Circular Fashion. High demand but with recycling and reuse systems.
Can technology and recycling offset the environmental impact of high consumer demand?

Here's what our model reveals: A $5 T-shirt costs the planet enormously because the price tag hides the true environmental cost. Consumer demand for cheap, trendy clothing drives manufacturers to produce at breakneck speed using enormous quantities of water (2,700 liters per shirt), generating massive carbon emissions (10% of global total), and creating 92 million tons of textile waste annually. The model reveals a one-directional cascade: consumer demand drives production rate, which simultaneously increases water consumption, carbon emissions, and textile waste. The system is designed to be disposable — and the planet pays the hidden price.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Consumer Demand?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Microplastic Pollution — Synthetic fabrics like polyester shed microscopic plastic fibers during washing — a single load of laundry releases up to 700,000 microplastic fibers into waterways, entering the food chain and accumulating in marine organisms and human tissue
   • Labor Exploitation — The social cost of fast fashion: garment workers in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia earn as little as $2/day in unsafe conditions. The Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 killed 1,134 garment workers, exposing the human cost of cheap clothing.
   • Chemical Runoff — Textile dyeing and finishing use over 8,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are discharged untreated into rivers near factories. The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter of freshwater globally, after agriculture.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Fast Fashion Business Model — how does this connect to your model?
   • Water: The Hidden Cost — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model reveal the hidden environmental cost behind a cheap price tag?
   • Why does reducing consumer demand have a bigger environmental impact than improving recycling?
   • What responsibility do consumers have versus manufacturers in reducing fashion's environmental footprint?
   • How does social media's influence on fashion trends connect to the environmental cascade in your model?

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 5 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Microplastic Pollution. Synthetic fabrics like polyester shed microscopic plastic fibers during washing — a single load of laundry releases up to 700,000 microplastic fibers into waterways, entering the food chain and accumulating in marine organisms and human tissue
How would you model that?

Labor Exploitation. The social cost of fast fashion: garment workers in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia earn as little as $2/day in unsafe conditions. The Rana Plaza collapse in 2013 killed 1,134 garment workers, exposing the human cost of cheap clothing.
How would you model that?

Chemical Runoff. Textile dyeing and finishing use over 8,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are discharged untreated into rivers near factories. The fashion industry is the second-largest polluter of freshwater globally, after agriculture.
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

TEACHER GUIDE: Fast Fashion Is Killing the Planet
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The fashion industry has quietly become one of the most destructive industries on Earth. While we obsess over oil companies and car emissions, the clothes on your back account for 10% of global carbon emissions, consume 79 trillion liters of water annually, and generate 92 million tons of waste per year. And it's accelerating — clothing production has doubled since 2000.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS3-4, HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems. Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Analyzing and Interpreting Data
  Students analyze data on water usage, carbon emissions, and waste generation across the fashion supply chain to evaluate the environmental impact of consumer behavior and production practices.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems / ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions
  The fashion industry demonstrates how human industrial activity impacts multiple Earth systems — water, atmosphere, and land — simultaneously. Students evaluate technological and behavioral solutions to reduce these impacts.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students trace the causal chain from consumer purchasing decisions through industrial production to measurable environmental consequences, demonstrating how individual actions aggregate into global system-level effects.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Fast Fashion, Textile Waste, Water Footprint, Carbon Footprint
□ Prepare How does a $5 T-shirt end up costing the planet so much discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify consumer demand, production rate, textile waste, water consumption, and carbon emissions as the key components of the fast fashion environmental impact system.
• Establish: Students determine that consumer demand drives production rate, which simultaneously increases textile waste, water consumption, and carbon emissions — a one-directional cascade with demand as the primary driver.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing how purchasing decisions cascade through the supply chain to create measurable environmental damage across multiple Earth systems.
• Evaluate: Students run business-as-usual, buy-less, and circular fashion scenarios to compare the environmental impact of demand reduction versus technological solutions.
• Revise: Students add microplastic pollution, labor exploitation, or chemical runoff to model more complete environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Fast Fashion Business Model:
  Fast fashion is built on speed, volume, and disposability. Traditional fashion had 2-4 seasons per year; Zara introduced 24 'micro-seasons.' Shein uploads 2,000-10,000 new styles DAILY. The model works by making clothes so cheap that consumers treat them as disposable — wearing garments an average of 7 times before discarding them. The average American buys 68 garments per year, up from 25 in 1960. Globally, 150 billion garments are produced annually for 8 billion people.

• Water: The Hidden Cost:
  Cotton is the most water-intensive crop used in fashion. Growing enough cotton for a single T-shirt requires 2,700 liters of water — equivalent to one person's drinking water for 2.5 years. Dyeing and finishing add more: textile dyeing is the second-largest polluter of clean water globally. The Aral Sea, once the world's fourth-largest lake, has virtually disappeared due in part to cotton irrigation for the textile industry. The fashion industry consumes 79 trillion liters of water annually.

• Carbon Emissions: Fashion's Climate Impact:
  The fashion industry produces approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year — 10% of global emissions. This exceeds international flights and maritime shipping combined. The carbon comes from every stage: petroleum-based synthetic fibers (polyester = plastic = oil), energy-intensive manufacturing, global shipping, and methane from decomposing textile waste in landfills. If the industry continues on its current trajectory, its emissions will increase by 50% by 2030.

• Textile Waste: Mountains of Clothes:
  Of the 150 billion garments produced annually, 87% end up in landfills or incinerators. Less than 1% of clothing is recycled into new clothing. Even donated clothes face grim fates — only 10-20% of donated items are sold domestically; the rest are exported to developing nations where they're often dumped in landfills, destroying local textile industries. In Ghana's Kantamanto market, 40% of imported secondhand clothes arrive in such poor condition they go directly to the dump.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Donating old clothes is sustainable"
  Reality: Only 10-20% of donated clothing is sold domestically. The rest is exported to developing nations, where up to 40% ends up in landfills — the same fate it would have had at home, just in a poorer country. Donation makes us FEEL sustainable without actually solving the waste problem. The most impactful action is buying less in the first place.
  Strategy: Show the data: Follow a donated shirt's journey from the Goodwill bin to a landfill in Ghana. Ask: Is this what you imagined when you donated?

• "Recycled clothing solves the waste problem"
  Reality: Less than 1% of clothing is recycled into new clothing. Most 'recycled' textiles are downcycled into insulation, rags, or stuffing — and even that represents a tiny fraction of total waste. The technology to turn an old T-shirt into a new T-shirt at scale doesn't exist yet. Recycling is important but cannot offset the volume of waste created by current production levels.
  Strategy: Math check: If we recycle 1% of 92 million tons of textile waste, that's 920,000 tons recycled — and 91 million tons still going to landfills. Can recycling alone solve this?

• "Sustainable fashion is too expensive for normal people"
  Reality: Fast fashion is artificially cheap because environmental costs are externalized — someone else pays for the water, carbon, and waste. A $5 shirt isn't actually cheap; the true cost is just hidden. Moreover, cost-per-wear analysis shows that a $50 quality garment worn 100 times ($0.50/wear) is cheaper than a $5 garment worn 5 times ($1.00/wear) before falling apart.
  Strategy: Calculate: You buy twelve $5 shirts that each last 2 months, or two $30 shirts that each last a year. Same time period — which costs more? Which creates more waste?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does a $5 T-shirt end up costing the planet so much?
Answer: A $5 T-shirt costs the planet enormously because the price tag hides the true environmental cost. Consumer demand for cheap, trendy clothing drives manufacturers to produce at breakneck speed using enormous quantities of water (2,700 liters per shirt), generating massive carbon emissions (10% of global total), and creating 92 million tons of textile waste annually. The model reveals a one-directional cascade: consumer demand drives production rate, which simultaneously increases water consumption, carbon emissions, and textile waste. The system is designed to be disposable — and the planet pays the hidden price.

Simulation Answers:
• Business as Usual Scenario: When Consumer Demand stays at current high levels, Production Rate continues at 150 billion garments annually. Textile Waste remains at 92 million tons/year, Water Consumption at 79 trillion liters/year, and Carbon Emissions at 1.2 billion tons CO2/year. The model shows all environmental indicators continuing to climb as fast fashion accelerates, with projections suggesting a 50% increase in emissions by 2030.
• Buy Less Movement Scenario: When Consumer Demand drops by 50%, Production Rate halves accordingly. Textile Waste, Water Consumption, and Carbon Emissions all decrease roughly proportionally — the model shows this demand reduction cuts environmental impact more effectively than any recycling technology because it prevents damage at the SOURCE (production stage) rather than trying to clean up at the END (disposal stage).

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does reducing demand beat recycling?
  A: The model reveals that the vast majority of environmental damage — water consumption, carbon emissions, chemical pollution — occurs during PRODUCTION, not disposal. Recycling only addresses the waste component, and current technology can only recycle less than 1% of clothing into new clothing anyway. When you reduce demand, you prevent production from happening in the first place, which means the water is never consumed, the carbon is never emitted, and the waste is never generated. It's the difference between cleaning up a mess and never making the mess.
• Q: What responsibility do consumers have?
  A: The model shows that consumer demand is the external driver of the entire system — it's literally the input that controls all outputs. This means individual purchasing decisions aggregate into massive environmental consequences. However, the system is DESIGNED to stimulate demand through aggressive marketing, artificially low prices, and social media trend cycles. Responsibility is shared: consumers can choose to buy less, but companies design the addictive cycle and governments fail to regulate the externalities. Systemic change requires action at all three levels.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Sustainable Fashion Solution
Mission: Design a business model, technology, or system that reduces the environmental footprint of the clothing industry while remaining economically viable and appealing to teenage consumers.
Scenario: A major clothing retailer wants to become more sustainable but can't afford to lose teenage customers. They've hired your team to design a solution — whether it's a new material, a recycling system, a rental service, or a completely new business model — that dramatically reduces water, carbon, and waste while keeping clothes affordable and trendy.
Introduction: Frame this as a design-for-sustainability challenge. Students are consultants hired by a major retailer that wants to reduce its environmental impact while remaining profitable and appealing to teenage consumers. The solution must address at least two of the three environmental outputs (waste, water, carbon).

Key Concepts:
• Circular Economy: An economic model where products are designed to be reused, repaired, and recycled rather than discarded. In fashion, this means designing garments for disassembly, using mono-materials that can be recycled, and creating take-back programs where old clothes become raw material for new ones.
• Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): A scientific method for measuring the total environmental impact of a product from raw material extraction ('cradle') through manufacturing, use, and disposal ('grave'). LCA reveals that a polyester shirt's biggest impact is manufacturing, while cotton's is water-intensive agriculture.
• Sustainable Materials Innovation: New technologies are creating fabrics from unexpected sources: mushroom leather (Mylo), orange peel fiber (Orange Fiber), recycled ocean plastic (Parley), and lab-grown spider silk (Bolt Threads). These materials can match conventional performance with a fraction of the environmental footprint.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Solution targets the highest-impact stage of the supply chain, addresses multiple environmental outputs, includes a viable business model, appeals to teen consumers, and uses evidence from the computational model
• Proficient (3): Solution addresses a real environmental impact with a reasonable approach and considers both sustainability and consumer appeal
• Developing (2): Solution addresses one environmental issue but lacks business viability, consumer appeal, or connection to model data
• Beginning (1): Solution is incomplete or doesn't realistically address fashion's environmental impact

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a fashion supply chain diagram showing environmental impact at each stage for quick reference
  • Use real product comparisons: $5 Shein shirt vs. $35 sustainably-made shirt — what accounts for the price difference?
  • Sentence frames: 'When consumer demand increases, production rate __ which causes water consumption to __ and carbon emissions to __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research and calculate the total environmental footprint of your wardrobe — how much water, carbon, and waste does everything you own represent?
  • Investigate how the secondhand clothing market (Depop, ThredUp, Goodwill) is disrupting fast fashion and analyze whether it truly reduces environmental impact or just delays disposal
  • Compare the environmental impact per wearing of a $5 Shein shirt worn 5 times versus a $50 quality shirt worn 100 times — which is actually cheaper per use?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the per-garment environmental cost: If the fashion industry uses 79 trillion liters of water for 150 billion garments, what is the average water footprint per item? Compare to per-capita water access in water-scarce nations.
  • ELA: Write an investigative journalism piece exposing the hidden environmental and social costs of a specific fast fashion brand, citing data from your model and external research
  • Social Studies: Research the global justice dimension: How does textile waste exported from wealthy nations to Ghana, Chile, and Kenya affect local economies, environments, and communities?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the causal relationship between consumer demand, industrial production, and multi-system environmental impact
• Evaluate technological and behavioral solutions to reduce the fashion industry's environmental footprint
• Predict the long-term environmental consequences of current consumption trends using computational models

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Analyze: A clothing company claims it has become 'carbon neutral' by offsetting its emissions. Using your model, explain why carbon offsets alone don't address the full environmental impact of fast fashion — what other components are still causing damage?
• Evaluate: Compare two solutions: (A) a new recycling technology that can process 50% of textile waste into new fabric, and (B) a cultural shift where consumers buy 50% fewer garments. Using evidence from your model, which solution would have a greater total environmental impact?

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Sustainable Fashion Solution
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a business model, technology, or system that reduces the environmental footprint of the clothing industry while remaining economically viable and appealing to teenage consumers.

SCENARIO: A major clothing retailer wants to become more sustainable but can't afford to lose teenage customers. They've hired your team to design a solution — whether it's a new material, a recycling system, a rental service, or a completely new business model — that dramatically reduces water, carbon, and waste while keeping clothes affordable and trendy.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What stage of the fashion supply chain causes the most environmental damage, and how would your solution target it?
• How would you make sustainable fashion cool enough that teenagers actually choose it over fast fashion?
• What trade-offs would your solution require, and are they acceptable?

DESIGN THINKING:
• Would your solution focus on the production side (materials, manufacturing), the consumer side (behavior change, rental models), or the disposal side (recycling, upcycling)?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you measure whether your solution actually reduces environmental impact?

  _________________________________________________________

• What would your sustainable clothing cost, and would your target market pay that price?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you scale your solution to make a measurable impact on the industry's 92 million tons of annual textile waste?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Solution targets the highest-impact stage of the supply chain, addresses multiple environmental outputs, includes a viable business model, appeals to teen consumers, and uses evidence from the computational model
• Proficient (3): Solution addresses a real environmental impact with a reasonable approach and considers both sustainability and consumer appeal
• Developing (2): Solution addresses one environmental issue but lacks business viability, consumer appeal, or connection to model data
• Beginning (1): Solution is incomplete or doesn't realistically address fashion's environmental impact
