### Title
**The Vaping Crisis: What's Really Happening to Your Lungs? — Modeling Chemical Damage to the Respiratory System**

### Overview
The human respiratory system is a marvel of biological engineering — 300 million alveoli provide a gas exchange surface area the size of a tennis court. But this delicate tissue was never designed to handle the chemical cocktail delivered by e-cigarettes. Understanding the hierarchical organization of the lungs is essential for understanding how vaping causes damage at every level. Students investigate the driving question: If vaping is "just water vapor," why are teenagers ending up in the hospital? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE VAPING CRISIS: WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING TO YOUR LUNGS?

Modeling Chemical Damage to the Respiratory System.
If vaping is "just water vapor," why are teenagers ending up in the hospital?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Nicotine Concentration" — the amount of nicotine and associated chemicals delivered to the lungs with each vaping session
  ○ Click "Chemical Exposure Duration" — the total time the lung tissue has been exposed to vaping chemicals — from days to years of use
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Lung Cell Health" — the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells lining the airways and alveoli
  ○ Click "Inflammation Response" — the intensity of the immune system's reaction to chemical irritation in the lungs

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"If vaping is "just water vapor," why are teenagers ending up in the hospital?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Nicotine Concentration' — that's external. The amount of nicotine and associated chemicals delivered to the lungs with each vaping session.
Click on 'Chemical Exposure Duration' — that's external. The total time the lung tissue has been exposed to vaping chemicals — from days to years of use.
Click on 'Lung Cell Health' — that's internal. The structural integrity and function of epithelial cells lining the airways and alveoli.
Click on 'Inflammation Response' — that's internal. The intensity of the immune system's reaction to chemical irritation in the lungs.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Nicotine Concentration and Chemical Exposure Duration are external components because they are determined by the user's vaping behavior — how much they vape and for how long. Lung Cell Health and Inflammation Response are internal because they are biological responses that the body produces in reaction to the external chemical exposure.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Nicotine Concentration" and drag an arrow to "Lung Cell Health"
• Click on "Chemical Exposure Duration" and drag an arrow to "Inflammation Response"
• Click on "Inflammation Response" and drag an arrow to "Lung Cell Health"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Nicotine Concentration → Lung Cell Health = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher nicotine and chemical concentrations directly damage epithelial cells lining the airways. The chemicals cause oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cell death in the delicate lung tissue.

  ○ Chemical Exposure Duration → Inflammation Response = POSITIVE (+)
    Longer exposure duration means the immune system remains activated for extended periods. Chronic exposure leads to persistent, escalating inflammation that never fully resolves.

  ○ Inflammation Response → Lung Cell Health = NEGATIVE (−)
    Chronic inflammation damages healthy lung cells through collateral damage from immune molecules. The immune response meant to protect the lungs ends up accelerating tissue destruction.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 1 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If Nicotine Concentration is high and Chemical Exposure Duration increases over months, what happens to the cycle between Inflammation Response and Lung Cell Health? Can the lungs recover?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Nicotine Concentration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Lung Cell Health.'

Here's the key question: When nicotine concentration goes UP, does
lung cell health go UP or DOWN?

Higher nicotine and chemical concentrations directly damage epithelial cells lining the airways. The chemicals cause oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cell death in the delicate lung tissue.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Chemical Exposure Duration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Inflammation Response.'

Here's the key question: When chemical exposure duration goes UP, does
inflammation response go UP or DOWN?

Longer exposure duration means the immune system remains activated for extended periods. Chronic exposure leads to persistent, escalating inflammation that never fully resolves.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Inflammation Response' and drag an arrow
over to 'Lung Cell Health.'

Here's the key question: When inflammation response goes UP, does
lung cell health go UP or DOWN?

Chronic inflammation damages healthy lung cells through collateral damage from immune molecules. The immune response meant to protect the lungs ends up accelerating tissue destruction.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 1
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

If Nicotine Concentration is high and Chemical Exposure Duration increases over months, what happens to the cycle between Inflammation Response and Lung Cell Health? Can the lungs recover?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Nicotine Concentration is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — OCCASIONAL USE
• Low nicotine, short duration
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Lung Cell Health with occasional, low-level vaping?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — DAILY HEAVY USE
• High nicotine, long duration
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the Inflammation Response with chronic, heavy vaping?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — QUIT AFTER 6 MONTHS
• High exposure followed by cessation
• PREDICT FIRST: Do you predict Lung Cell Health will fully recover after quitting? Why or why not?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Nicotine and vaping chemicals directly damage epithelial cells, reducing their ability to protect the lungs and facilitate gas exchange
• Chronic inflammation creates a destructive cycle — the immune response meant to heal actually causes additional tissue damage over time
• The damage is cumulative and not always reversible — some lung cell damage becomes permanent after prolonged exposure
• Short-term effects are mild enough to ignore, which is why many vapers don't realize the damage until it's significant

THE ANSWER: Vaping is NOT just water vapor — it delivers nicotine, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds directly into the lungs. These chemicals damage the epithelial cells lining the airways and trigger chronic inflammation. The inflammation meant to protect the lungs actually accelerates tissue destruction in a vicious cycle. Over time, this cascade reduces lung function, and some damage becomes permanent.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Occasional Use. Low nicotine, short duration.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Daily Heavy Use.
High nicotine, long duration.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to the Inflammation Response with chronic, heavy vaping?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Quit After 6 Months. High exposure followed by cessation.
Do you predict Lung Cell Health will fully recover after quitting? Why or why not?

Here's what our model reveals: Vaping is NOT just water vapor — it delivers nicotine, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds directly into the lungs. These chemicals damage the epithelial cells lining the airways and trigger chronic inflammation. The inflammation meant to protect the lungs actually accelerates tissue destruction in a vicious cycle. Over time, this cascade reduces lung function, and some damage becomes permanent.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Nicotine Concentration?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Chemical Exposure Duration?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Oxygen Exchange Rate — The efficiency of gas exchange in the alveoli, which decreases as cells are damaged and airways become inflamed
   • Mucociliary Clearance — The lung's self-cleaning mechanism using mucus and tiny hair-like cilia to sweep out particles and pathogens
   • Immune Cell Activity — The concentration and behavior of white blood cells in lung tissue, which increases with chronic chemical exposure

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Respiratory System Organization — how does this connect to your model?
   • What's Actually in Vape Aerosol — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model show the difference between short-term and long-term effects of vaping?
   • Why does the inflammation response — which is meant to protect you — end up causing more damage?
   • What does your model predict about lung recovery if someone quits vaping after one year versus five years?
   • How might your model change if you added oxygen exchange rate as a component?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Oxygen Exchange Rate. The efficiency of gas exchange in the alveoli, which decreases as cells are damaged and airways become inflamed
How would you model that?

Mucociliary Clearance. The lung's self-cleaning mechanism using mucus and tiny hair-like cilia to sweep out particles and pathogens
How would you model that?

Immune Cell Activity. The concentration and behavior of white blood cells in lung tissue, which increases with chronic chemical exposure
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Vaping Crisis: What's Really Happening to Your Lungs?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The human respiratory system is a marvel of biological engineering — 300 million alveoli provide a gas exchange surface area the size of a tennis court. But this delicate tissue was never designed to handle the chemical cocktail delivered by e-cigarettes. Understanding the hierarchical organization of the lungs is essential for understanding how vaping causes damage at every level.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS1-2: Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model to illustrate how chemical exposure progressively damages the hierarchical organization of lung tissue.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function
  Multicellular organisms have hierarchical structural organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous parts that interact to carry out life functions.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students trace the causal chain from chemical exposure to cellular damage to systemic inflammation and reduced lung function.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Inflammation Response, Epithelial Cells, Chronic Exposure, Alveolar Damage
□ Prepare If vaping is "just water vapor," why are teenagers ending up in the hospital discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify nicotine concentration, chemical exposure duration, lung cell health, and inflammation response as the key components of the vaping damage system.
• Establish: Students determine that nicotine concentration decreases lung cell health, exposure duration increases inflammation, and inflammation further decreases cell health — creating a destructive feedback loop.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing how chemical exposure leads to progressive lung damage through the inflammation-damage cycle.
• Evaluate: Students run occasional use, daily heavy use, and cessation scenarios to compare short-term versus long-term outcomes and recovery potential.
• Revise: Students add oxygen exchange rate, mucociliary clearance, or immune cell activity to model more complete respiratory system dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Respiratory System Organization:
  The respiratory system follows a hierarchical structure: the trachea branches into bronchi, which branch into bronchioles, which terminate in alveoli. Each level is lined with specialized epithelial cells. Alveoli are surrounded by capillaries where oxygen enters the blood and CO2 is removed. This organization maximizes surface area for gas exchange.

• What's Actually in Vape Aerosol:
  E-cigarette aerosol is not water vapor. It contains nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, formaldehyde, acrolein, heavy metals (lead, nickel, chromium), and ultrafine particles. When heated, these chemicals undergo pyrolysis, creating new toxic compounds. The ultrafine particles penetrate deep into the alveoli where there is no mucociliary clearance.

• Inflammation as a Double-Edged Sword:
  When chemicals damage lung cells, the immune system responds with inflammation — sending white blood cells, releasing cytokines, and increasing blood flow to the area. Short-term, this helps clear damage. But chronic inflammation causes collateral damage: healthy cells are destroyed, scar tissue forms, and the inflammatory molecules themselves damage surrounding tissue. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of damage.

• EVALI and Youth Vaping:
  In 2019, EVALI (E-cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury) hospitalized over 2,800 people and killed 68 in the US. Most were under 35. Even without acute EVALI, chronic vaping causes measurable reductions in lung function, increased respiratory symptoms, and cellular changes that may increase cancer risk. Adolescent lungs are especially vulnerable because they're still developing.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Vaping is just water vapor"
  Reality: E-cigarette aerosol contains nicotine, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and ultrafine particles — not water vapor. The base liquids (propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin) break down into formaldehyde and acrolein when heated. These chemicals cause direct cellular damage.
  Strategy: Show the chemical analysis of vape aerosol side by side with actual water vapor. Ask: Would you inhale formaldehyde if it wasn't hidden in a flavored cloud?

• "If I don't feel sick, it's not hurting me"
  Reality: Cumulative damage often has no symptoms until it's significant. Like high blood pressure or UV skin damage, vaping causes progressive cellular changes that aren't felt day-to-day but show up on medical tests and eventually as symptoms.
  Strategy: Analogy: You don't feel a sunburn forming while you're getting it — you feel it hours later. Lung damage works similarly, but over months and years instead of hours.

• "Vaping is safe because it's FDA-regulated"
  Reality: E-cigarettes are regulated as tobacco products, not as safe products. The FDA has authorized very few e-cigarettes and only for adults already addicted to cigarettes as a harm-reduction tool — not as a safe alternative for non-smokers. No e-cigarettes have been approved as safe for youth.
  Strategy: Compare: Cars are regulated, but they're not safe to drive at 150 mph. Regulation doesn't mean safe — it means there are rules about how dangerous something is allowed to be.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: If vaping is "just water vapor," why are teenagers ending up in the hospital?
Answer: Vaping is NOT just water vapor — it delivers nicotine, heavy metals, and volatile organic compounds directly into the lungs. These chemicals damage the epithelial cells lining the airways and trigger chronic inflammation. The inflammation meant to protect the lungs actually accelerates tissue destruction in a vicious cycle. Over time, this cascade reduces lung function, and some damage becomes permanent.

Simulation Answers:
• Occasional Use Scenario: With low Nicotine Concentration and short Chemical Exposure Duration, Lung Cell Health decreases slightly and Inflammation Response is mild. The lungs' repair mechanisms can mostly keep up with the damage, and recovery is possible if exposure stops. However, even low-level exposure causes measurable cellular changes.
• Daily Heavy Use Scenario: With high Nicotine Concentration over long duration, the model shows a devastating cascade. Lung Cell Health drops dramatically as both direct chemical damage and chronic inflammation compound. The inflammation-damage feedback loop accelerates tissue destruction, and some damage becomes irreversible as scar tissue replaces functional lung tissue.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does inflammation make things worse?
  A: Inflammation is designed for short-term injury repair — white blood cells arrive, clean up damage, and leave. But chronic chemical exposure means inflammation never turns off. The immune molecules (reactive oxygen species, cytokines) that kill damaged cells also destroy healthy neighboring cells. It's like using a flamethrower to put out a candle — the cure becomes worse than the disease.
• Q: Can lungs fully recover after quitting?
  A: It depends on duration and severity. The model shows that short-term users can recover most lung cell health because the damage hasn't reached the point of permanent scarring. But long-term heavy users sustain irreversible damage — scar tissue (fibrosis) replaces functional lung tissue and cannot regenerate. The earlier someone quits, the more recovery is possible.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Vaping Impact Public Health Campaign
Mission: Create a science-based public health campaign that uses data from your model to show teens the real biological impact of vaping on lung tissue.
Scenario: The local health department has noticed a 40% increase in teen vaping and wants to launch a campaign that goes beyond 'just say no.' They need scientifically accurate materials that show WHAT actually happens inside the lungs. Your team has been hired to create the campaign using your model data.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A health department needs a science-based campaign showing teens what vaping actually does to lung tissue. Your team will create campaign materials using data from your computational model to replace myths with biological evidence.

Key Concepts:
• Dose-Response Relationships: The severity of biological damage is related to both the concentration of a substance and the duration of exposure. Higher doses and longer exposure produce more severe effects — but even low doses cause measurable changes.
• Cumulative Damage: Some biological damage accumulates over time and isn't immediately noticeable. Like sun damage to skin, the effects of vaping on lung cells build up silently until clinical symptoms appear.
• Science Communication: Effective health campaigns translate complex biological mechanisms into clear, compelling messages. The best campaigns use data visualization, relatable comparisons, and evidence-based claims rather than fear tactics.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Campaign uses model data accurately, presents biological mechanisms clearly, addresses common misconceptions, and uses effective science communication techniques
• Proficient (3): Campaign presents accurate scientific information and uses some model data to support claims
• Developing (2): Campaign contains scientific information but lacks clear connection to model evidence or contains minor inaccuracies
• Beginning (1): Campaign is incomplete, scientifically inaccurate, or relies on fear tactics without evidence

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a labeled diagram of lung anatomy showing alveoli, bronchioles, and epithelial cell layers
  • Use a timeline graphic to help visualize cumulative damage over weeks, months, and years
  • Sentence frames: 'When __ enters the lungs, the body responds by __, which causes __ over time'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the chemical composition of five popular vape brands and compare their potential for lung damage
  • Investigate how the developing adolescent lung responds differently to chemical exposure compared to adult lungs
  • Compare the biological mechanisms of vaping damage to those of traditional cigarette smoking

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Analyze dose-response data and create graphs showing the relationship between vaping frequency and measured lung function decline
  • ELA: Analyze the marketing language used by e-cigarette companies and write a critical response using scientific evidence
  • Health: Research the addictive properties of nicotine and create an infographic showing the neurological pathway of addiction

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how chemical exposure damages the hierarchical structure of the respiratory system
• Explain the feedback loop between inflammation and cell damage in chronically exposed lungs
• Predict long-term health outcomes based on vaping frequency and duration

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A student has been vaping daily for one year. Which model prediction best explains why their lung function test shows a 15% decrease even though they feel fine?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain the biological mechanism by which chronic vaping leads to progressive lung damage. Include the roles of inflammation and epithelial cell health in your explanation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NAME: _________________________ DATE: _____________

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRE-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. What do you think is actually inside vape aerosol — is it just water vapor?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. Why do you think vaping-related lung injuries have become so common in teens?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. Draw what you think happens to lung cells when exposed to vaping chemicals.

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Inflammation Response         
___ Epithelial Cells              
___ Chronic Exposure              
___ Alveolar Damage               

A. The body's immune reaction to injury or irritation — sending white blood cells and fluids to the damaged area, causing swelling, redness, and reduced function
B. The thin layer of cells lining the lungs' airways and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange and protect against pathogens
C. Repeated contact with a harmful substance over weeks, months, or years — causing cumulative damage that may not be immediately apparent
D. Destruction or impairment of the tiny air sacs in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged with the bloodstream

REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. How does your model show the difference between short-term and long-term effects of vaping?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. Why does the inflammation response — which is meant to protect you — end up causing more damage?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. What does your model predict about lung recovery if someone quits vaping after one year versus five years?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. How might your model change if you added oxygen exchange rate as a component?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. What are the limitations of modeling complex biological damage with only four components?

   _________________________________________________________

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Vaping Impact Public Health Campaign
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Create a science-based public health campaign that uses data from your model to show teens the real biological impact of vaping on lung tissue.

SCENARIO: The local health department has noticed a 40% increase in teen vaping and wants to launch a campaign that goes beyond 'just say no.' They need scientifically accurate materials that show WHAT actually happens inside the lungs. Your team has been hired to create the campaign using your model data.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What biological evidence from your model is most compelling for convincing teens?
• How can you present cumulative damage data in a way that resonates with 14-15 year olds?
• What makes science-based messaging more effective than fear-based messaging?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What format will your campaign take — social media, poster, video, interactive website?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you visualize the damage cascade from your model in an engaging way?

  _________________________________________________________

• What data from your simulations will you use as evidence?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you address the misconception that vaping is harmless?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Campaign uses model data accurately, presents biological mechanisms clearly, addresses common misconceptions, and uses effective science communication techniques
• Proficient (3): Campaign presents accurate scientific information and uses some model data to support claims
• Developing (2): Campaign contains scientific information but lacks clear connection to model evidence or contains minor inaccuracies
• Beginning (1): Campaign is incomplete, scientifically inaccurate, or relies on fear tactics without evidence
