### Title
**Can We Actually Live on Mars? — Modeling Survival in the Most Hostile Environment Humans Have Ever Faced**

### Overview
Mars is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system — and it's still incredibly hostile to human life. With less than 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure, average temperatures of -60°C, no breathable oxygen, lethal radiation, and no liquid surface water, Mars represents the ultimate engineering challenge: can humans recreate the conditions for life on a world that has none? Students investigate the driving question: What would it actually take to keep humans alive on Mars — and is it even possible? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

CAN WE ACTUALLY LIVE ON MARS?

Modeling Survival in the Most Hostile Environment Humans Have Ever Faced.
What would it actually take to keep humans alive on Mars — and is it even possible?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Atmospheric Pressure" — the air pressure inside the habitat
  ○ Click "Radiation Exposure" — the amount of ionizing radiation reaching the habitat interior
  ○ Click "Water Availability" — the amount of extractable water from martian ice deposits and recycled wastewater for drinking
  ○ Click "Temperature" — the internal habitat temperature
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Crop Viability" — the ability of food crops to grow

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 5 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"What would it actually take to keep humans alive on Mars — and is it even possible?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Atmospheric Pressure' — that's external. The air pressure inside the habitat, which must be maintained above 6.
Click on 'Radiation Exposure' — that's external. The amount of ionizing radiation reaching the habitat interior.
Click on 'Water Availability' — that's external. The amount of extractable water from Martian ice deposits and recycled wastewater for drinking.
Click on 'Temperature' — that's external. The internal habitat temperature.
Click on 'Crop Viability' — that's internal. The ability of food crops to grow.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Atmospheric Pressure, Radiation Exposure, Water Availability, and Temperature are all external because they represent Mars environmental conditions that exist independently of the habitat and must be actively countered through engineering. Crop Viability is the sole internal component because it is the biological outcome that depends on all four external factors being maintained within acceptable ranges.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 5 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Atmospheric Pressure" and drag an arrow to "Crop Viability"
• Click on "Radiation Exposure" and drag an arrow to "Crop Viability"
• Click on "Water Availability" and drag an arrow to "Crop Viability"
• Click on "Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Crop Viability"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Atmospheric Pressure → Crop Viability = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher atmospheric pressure inside the habitat allows liquid water to exist and plants to photosynthesize. Below the critical threshold, water boils at room temperature and plants cannot survive.

  ○ Radiation Exposure → Crop Viability = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher radiation damages plant DNA, reduces photosynthetic efficiency, and can kill crops. Effective shielding is essential for agricultural viability.

  ○ Water Availability → Crop Viability = POSITIVE (+)
    More available water directly supports plant growth, transpiration, and nutrient transport. Water scarcity is the most immediate threat to food production.

  ○ Temperature → Crop Viability = POSITIVE (+)
    Crop viability increases as temperature approaches the optimal growth range (18-26°C). Both extreme cold and extreme heat reduce or eliminate crop yields.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 4 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If any ONE of the external factors — pressure, radiation, water, or temperature — fails, what happens to Crop Viability and the entire colony's food supply? What makes this system so fragile?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Atmospheric Pressure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Crop Viability.'

Here's the key question: When atmospheric pressure goes UP, does
crop viability go UP or DOWN?

Higher atmospheric pressure inside the habitat allows liquid water to exist and plants to photosynthesize. Below the critical threshold, water boils at room temperature and plants cannot survive.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Radiation Exposure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Crop Viability.'

Here's the key question: When radiation exposure goes UP, does
crop viability go UP or DOWN?

Higher radiation damages plant DNA, reduces photosynthetic efficiency, and can kill crops. Effective shielding is essential for agricultural viability.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Water Availability' and drag an arrow
over to 'Crop Viability.'

Here's the key question: When water availability goes UP, does
crop viability go UP or DOWN?

More available water directly supports plant growth, transpiration, and nutrient transport. Water scarcity is the most immediate threat to food production.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Crop Viability.'

Here's the key question: When temperature goes UP, does
crop viability go UP or DOWN?

Crop viability increases as temperature approaches the optimal growth range (18-26°C). Both extreme cold and extreme heat reduce or eliminate crop yields.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 3
positive relationships. 4 arrows total.

If any ONE of the external factors — pressure, radiation, water, or temperature — fails, what happens to Crop Viability and the entire colony's food supply? What makes this system so fragile?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Atmospheric Pressure is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — OPTIMAL HABITAT
• All systems functioning at ideal levels
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict Crop Viability will be when all environmental controls are working perfectly?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — PRESSURE BREACH
• Atmospheric Pressure drops to near-Mars surface levels
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Crop Viability and human survival if the habitat loses pressure?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — WATER CRISIS
• Water Availability drops to critical levels
• PREDICT FIRST: How do you predict the colony will respond when water becomes scarce?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Human survival on Mars requires simultaneously solving pressure, radiation, water, temperature, and food challenges — failure of any one system is catastrophic
• Crop viability depends on ALL four external factors being within acceptable ranges — it's the weakest link in the survival chain
• The system has almost no margin for error — a small change in any variable can cascade into colony-wide failure
• Mars colonization is fundamentally an engineering problem, not a discovery problem — we know what needs to happen, we just can't do it all yet

THE ANSWER: Living on Mars is theoretically possible but extraordinarily difficult. The planet offers almost nothing humans need: no breathable air, almost no atmospheric pressure, lethal radiation, temperatures averaging -60°C, and no liquid water on the surface. Every survival requirement must be engineered from scratch inside a sealed habitat. The biggest challenge isn't any single factor — it's that ALL of them must work simultaneously with no room for failure.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Optimal Habitat. All systems functioning at ideal levels.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Pressure Breach.
Atmospheric Pressure drops to near-Mars surface levels.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Crop Viability and human survival if the habitat loses pressure?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Water Crisis. Water Availability drops to critical levels.
How do you predict the colony will respond when water becomes scarce?

Here's what our model reveals: Living on Mars is theoretically possible but extraordinarily difficult. The planet offers almost nothing humans need: no breathable air, almost no atmospheric pressure, lethal radiation, temperatures averaging -60°C, and no liquid water on the surface. Every survival requirement must be engineered from scratch inside a sealed habitat. The biggest challenge isn't any single factor — it's that ALL of them must work simultaneously with no room for failure.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Atmospheric Pressure?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Radiation Exposure?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Water Availability?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Temperature?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Energy Production — The power generation capacity of the habitat using solar panels or nuclear reactors to run life support, heating, and agricultural systems
   • Oxygen Generation — The production of breathable oxygen through electrolysis of water or CO2 processing from the Martian atmosphere
   • Waste Recycling Efficiency — How effectively the habitat converts human waste, CO2, and wastewater back into usable resources in a closed-loop system

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Mars vs. Earth — how does this connect to your model?
   • Atmospheric Pressure Challenge — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is Mars colonization often described as 'the hardest engineering problem in human history'?
   • What does your model reveal about the difference between surviving on Mars and thriving on Mars?
   • Which of the five components is the most critical — and what happens if it fails?
   • How does your model change when you add energy production or oxygen generation?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 5 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Energy Production. The power generation capacity of the habitat using solar panels or nuclear reactors to run life support, heating, and agricultural systems
How would you model that?

Oxygen Generation. The production of breathable oxygen through electrolysis of water or CO2 processing from the Martian atmosphere
How would you model that?

Waste Recycling Efficiency. How effectively the habitat converts human waste, CO2, and wastewater back into usable resources in a closed-loop system
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Can We Actually Live on Mars?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Mars is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system — and it's still incredibly hostile to human life. With less than 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure, average temperatures of -60°C, no breathable oxygen, lethal radiation, and no liquid surface water, Mars represents the ultimate engineering challenge: can humans recreate the conditions for life on a world that has none?

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS1-2, HS-ETS1-2: Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence including light spectra, motion of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe. Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
  Students construct explanations of Mars survival challenges and design habitat solutions based on computational model evidence.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS1.B Earth and the Solar System / ETS1.C Optimizing the Design Solution
  Students analyze the conditions on Mars that differ from Earth and engineer solutions to sustain human life.
• Crosscutting Concept: Systems and System Models
  Students model Mars habitat as a system where multiple interacting components must simultaneously maintain conditions for human survival.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Atmospheric Pressure, Ionizing Radiation, Regolith, Bioregenerative Life Support
□ Prepare What would it actually take to keep humans alive on Mars — and is it even possible discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify atmospheric pressure, radiation exposure, water availability, temperature, and crop viability as the critical components of the Mars survival system.
• Establish: Students determine that all four external factors must be within acceptable ranges simultaneously for crop viability to be maintained — and that any single failure cascades through the system.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing how Mars habitat conditions interact to determine the feasibility of sustained human presence.
• Evaluate: Students run optimal, pressure breach, and water crisis scenarios to test their model and identify critical failure thresholds.
• Revise: Students add energy production, oxygen generation, or waste recycling to model more realistic habitat dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Mars vs. Earth:
  Mars has 38% of Earth's gravity, a thin CO2 atmosphere (95.3% CO2) at 0.6% of Earth's pressure, no global magnetic field, and surface temperatures from -125°C to 20°C. A human standing unprotected on Mars would simultaneously suffocate, freeze, be irradiated, and have their blood boil due to low pressure — all within about 15 seconds.

• Atmospheric Pressure Challenge:
  Earth's atmospheric pressure is 101.3 kPa. Mars surface pressure is 0.6 kPa. Liquid water requires at least 6.1 kPa; human breathing requires about 47.3 kPa of pressure with appropriate oxygen concentration. Any habitat must maintain this pressure differential against the near-vacuum of Mars — and a breach could be catastrophic.

• Radiation on Mars:
  Without Earth's protective magnetic field and thick atmosphere, Mars receives about 2.5 times the radiation astronauts experience on the ISS. Over a two-year stay, colonists would receive enough radiation to significantly increase cancer risk. Shielding options include burying habitats under regolith, using water walls, or developing advanced materials.

• Water and Food Production:
  Mars has significant water ice at its poles and underground. Extracting and purifying this water is essential for drinking, agriculture, and producing oxygen through electrolysis. Growing food on Mars requires controlled environments with artificial lighting, recycled water, and processed regolith — a system that must be virtually 100% efficient since resupply from Earth takes 6-9 months.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Mars is basically like a cold desert on Earth"
  Reality: Mars is nothing like any place on Earth. Its atmosphere is 100 times thinner, there's no breathable oxygen, radiation is lethal, and the average temperature is -60°C. Even the driest, coldest desert on Earth has thousands of times more air pressure and infinitely more water than Mars.
  Strategy: Compare: The highest point on Earth (Everest summit) has 33% of sea-level pressure. Mars has 0.6%. It's not even close.

• "We just need space suits to walk around on Mars"
  Reality: Space suits are emergency survival equipment, not a long-term solution. They're heavy, restrict movement, require constant maintenance, and have limited life support duration. A suit breach on Mars means death in seconds. Sustainable Mars living requires permanent pressurized structures.
  Strategy: Ask: Could you live your entire life in a scuba suit underwater? That's easier than what Mars demands.

• "We can terraform Mars to be like Earth"
  Reality: Terraforming Mars — making it Earth-like — would take centuries to millennia if it's even possible. Mars has lost most of its atmosphere to space because it lacks a global magnetic field. Even if we could warm it, the atmosphere would slowly escape. Realistic Mars habitation means sealed habitats, not open-air living.
  Strategy: Calculate: Earth's atmosphere took billions of years to develop. How long would it take to rebuild one on Mars from almost nothing?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: What would it actually take to keep humans alive on Mars — and is it even possible?
Answer: Living on Mars is theoretically possible but extraordinarily difficult. The planet offers almost nothing humans need: no breathable air, almost no atmospheric pressure, lethal radiation, temperatures averaging -60°C, and no liquid water on the surface. Every survival requirement must be engineered from scratch inside a sealed habitat. The biggest challenge isn't any single factor — it's that ALL of them must work simultaneously with no room for failure.

Simulation Answers:
• Optimal Habitat Scenario: When all external factors are at ideal levels — pressure at 101 kPa, radiation shielded, water abundant, temperature at 22°C — Crop Viability is at maximum. The system mirrors Earth-like growing conditions inside the sealed habitat, allowing food production sufficient for the crew.
• Pressure Breach Scenario: When Atmospheric Pressure drops toward Mars surface levels, the cascade is catastrophic. Water begins to boil at low temperatures, making irrigation impossible. Plants lose turgor pressure and wilt rapidly. Without pressurized atmosphere, both crops and humans are at immediate risk. This scenario demonstrates that pressure is the most time-critical failure mode.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is Mars colonization the hardest engineering problem?
  A: Because it requires solving multiple interdependent problems simultaneously with zero margin for error. On Earth, if one system fails, we have backup from the natural environment — breathable air, drinkable water, moderate temperatures. On Mars, every single survival requirement must be artificially maintained. The model shows that failure in any single component can cascade into total system collapse within hours or days.
• Q: Which factor is most critical?
  A: Atmospheric pressure is the most time-critical — a breach can kill within minutes. But water availability is the most strategically critical for long-term survival because it limits food production, oxygen generation, and crew health. The model reveals that 'most critical' depends on timescale: pressure for minutes, water for months, radiation for years.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Mars Habitat Module
Mission: Design a habitat module that addresses the five critical survival factors and can sustain a crew of six for one year using available Martian resources.
Scenario: NASA has announced the Mars Colony Design Challenge for high school students. Your team must design a habitat module that solves pressure, radiation, water, temperature, and food production simultaneously. The module must use in-situ Martian resources wherever possible and include failure contingency plans.
Introduction: Present the challenge: NASA is soliciting Mars habitat designs from student teams. Your module must sustain a crew of six for one year, addressing all five survival factors using Martian resources wherever possible. Include contingency plans for the failure modes your model identified.

Key Concepts:
• In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU): Using materials found on Mars — ice for water, regolith for shielding, CO2 atmosphere for fuel production — instead of transporting everything from Earth. This is the key to making Mars colonization economically possible.
• Closed-Loop Life Support: A system where waste products become inputs: CO2 from breathing feeds plants, plant waste becomes compost, wastewater is purified and reused. Perfect efficiency is the goal — every molecule must be recycled.
• Redundancy Engineering: Building backup systems for every critical function. In aerospace engineering, this means multiple independent systems that can maintain operations if the primary system fails — because on Mars, there's no rescue.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design addresses all five survival factors with detailed engineering solutions, uses ISRU where possible, includes redundancy for critical systems, and justifies design choices with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Design addresses most survival factors with reasonable engineering solutions and includes some failure contingencies
• Developing (2): Design addresses some survival factors but lacks detail, redundancy, or connection to model evidence
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't realistically address Mars survival challenges

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a Mars fact sheet comparing conditions to Earth for quick reference
  • Use a survival priority matrix to help students identify which factors to address first
  • Sentence frames: 'Our habitat addresses __ by __, which ensures that __ remains within safe limits'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the actual Mars habitat designs being developed by NASA and SpaceX and compare them to your model
  • Calculate the amount of water, food, and oxygen needed per person per day and design a recycling system to meet those needs
  • Investigate how the ISS currently handles life support and identify what would need to change for Mars

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the volume of pressurized habitat space needed per person and the energy required to maintain temperature and pressure
  • ELA: Write a mission proposal to NASA arguing for your habitat design, using evidence from your model simulations
  • Social Studies: Research the ethics and governance challenges of establishing a permanent Mars colony — who makes the rules?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the interdependent environmental factors required for human survival on Mars
• Analyze how failure of a single system cascades through the entire habitat
• Design engineering solutions based on computational model evidence

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A Mars habitat experiences a slow leak that reduces atmospheric pressure by 20% over three days. According to your model, which component would be affected FIRST?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain why Mars colonization requires solving all five survival factors simultaneously. What happens when even one factor drops below the critical threshold?

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Atmospheric Pressure          
___ Ionizing Radiation            
___ Regolith                      
___ Bioregenerative Life Support  

A. The force exerted by gas molecules pressing on a surface — Mars has less than 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure, making liquid water and unprotected human survival impossible
B. High-energy particles from the Sun and cosmic rays that damage DNA and living tissue — Mars lacks the magnetic field and thick atmosphere that protect Earth
C. The layer of loose rock and dust covering Mars' surface, which contains toxic perchlorates and lacks the organic matter and microorganisms found in Earth's soil
D. A system that uses living organisms — primarily plants — to recycle air, water, and waste in a closed habitat, reducing dependence on resupply from Earth

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Mars Habitat Module
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a habitat module that addresses the five critical survival factors and can sustain a crew of six for one year using available Martian resources.

SCENARIO: NASA has announced the Mars Colony Design Challenge for high school students. Your team must design a habitat module that solves pressure, radiation, water, temperature, and food production simultaneously. The module must use in-situ Martian resources wherever possible and include failure contingency plans.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How will you maintain atmospheric pressure and what happens if there's a breach?
• What materials and methods will you use for radiation shielding?
• How will you source and recycle water on Mars?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What shape and materials will provide the best pressure containment and radiation shielding?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you extract water from Martian ice and recycle wastewater?

  _________________________________________________________

• What crops are best suited for Mars habitat agriculture and how much growing space do six people need?

  _________________________________________________________

• What backup systems will you include for each critical failure mode?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design addresses all five survival factors with detailed engineering solutions, uses ISRU where possible, includes redundancy for critical systems, and justifies design choices with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Design addresses most survival factors with reasonable engineering solutions and includes some failure contingencies
• Developing (2): Design addresses some survival factors but lacks detail, redundancy, or connection to model evidence
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or doesn't realistically address Mars survival challenges
