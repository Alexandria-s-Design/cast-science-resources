### Title
**How Social Media Hacks Your Brain — Modeling Dopamine, Feedback Loops, and Digital Addiction**

### Overview
Your brain evolved over millions of years to seek rewards that helped your ancestors survive — food, social bonding, mating opportunities. Every time you found something rewarding, your brain released dopamine to say 'do that again.' Social media has hijacked this ancient system, delivering hyper-concentrated social rewards at a speed and frequency your brain was never designed to handle. Students investigate the driving question: Why can't you put your phone down — even when you know you should? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

HOW SOCIAL MEDIA HACKS YOUR BRAIN

Modeling Dopamine, Feedback Loops, and Digital Addiction.
Why can't you put your phone down — even when you know you should?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Notification Frequency" — the rate at which a social media platform sends push notifications
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Screen Time" — the total number of hours per day spent actively using social media platforms on phones
  ○ Click "Dopamine Release" — the amount of dopamine neurotransmitter released in the brain's reward circuit in response to social media interactions like likes
  ○ Click "Social Comparison" — the intensity of comparing oneself to others based on curated images
  ○ Click "Self-Esteem Level" — an individual's overall sense of self-worth

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 5 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why can't you put your phone down — even when you know you should?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Notification Frequency' — that's external. The rate at which a social media platform sends push notifications.
Click on 'Screen Time' — that's internal. The total number of hours per day spent actively using social media platforms on phones.
Click on 'Dopamine Release' — that's internal. The amount of dopamine neurotransmitter released in the brain's reward circuit in response to social media interactions like likes.
Click on 'Social Comparison' — that's internal. The intensity of comparing oneself to others based on curated images.
Click on 'Self-Esteem Level' — that's internal. An individual's overall sense of self-worth.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Notification Frequency is the external component because it is controlled by the social media platform's design team, not by the user's biology. Screen Time, Dopamine Release, Social Comparison, and Self-Esteem Level are all internal because they represent the user's neurological responses, behavioral patterns, and psychological states that change as a consequence of the external stimulus.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 5 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Notification Frequency" and drag an arrow to "Dopamine Release"
• Click on "Dopamine Release" and drag an arrow to "Screen Time"
• Click on "Screen Time" and drag an arrow to "Social Comparison"
• Click on "Social Comparison" and drag an arrow to "Self-Esteem Level"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Notification Frequency → Dopamine Release = POSITIVE (+)
    More frequent notifications create more opportunities for the brain's reward system to activate. Each buzz or badge triggers an anticipatory dopamine response, even before the user sees the content.

  ○ Dopamine Release → Screen Time = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher dopamine release reinforces phone-checking behavior. The brain learns that opening the app produces a reward, driving increased screen time as the user seeks to replicate the pleasurable feeling.

  ○ Screen Time → Social Comparison = POSITIVE (+)
    More time spent scrolling through feeds means more exposure to curated images of other people's lives, achievements, and appearances, intensifying the social comparison process.

  ○ Social Comparison → Self-Esteem Level = NEGATIVE (−)
    Increased social comparison — especially upward comparison to idealized, filtered content — erodes self-esteem as individuals perceive themselves as less attractive, successful, or popular than their peers appear online.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 4 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When Notification Frequency is high, what chain reaction does it trigger through Dopamine Release, Screen Time, Social Comparison, and ultimately Self-Esteem Level? Where does the feedback loop trap you?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Notification Frequency' and drag an arrow
over to 'Dopamine Release.'

Here's the key question: When notification frequency goes UP, does
dopamine release go UP or DOWN?

More frequent notifications create more opportunities for the brain's reward system to activate. Each buzz or badge triggers an anticipatory dopamine response, even before the user sees the content.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Dopamine Release' and drag an arrow
over to 'Screen Time.'

Here's the key question: When dopamine release goes UP, does
screen time go UP or DOWN?

Higher dopamine release reinforces phone-checking behavior. The brain learns that opening the app produces a reward, driving increased screen time as the user seeks to replicate the pleasurable feeling.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Screen Time' and drag an arrow
over to 'Social Comparison.'

Here's the key question: When screen time goes UP, does
social comparison go UP or DOWN?

More time spent scrolling through feeds means more exposure to curated images of other people's lives, achievements, and appearances, intensifying the social comparison process.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Social Comparison' and drag an arrow
over to 'Self-Esteem Level.'

Here's the key question: When social comparison goes UP, does
self-esteem level go UP or DOWN?

Increased social comparison — especially upward comparison to idealized, filtered content — erodes self-esteem as individuals perceive themselves as less attractive, successful, or popular than their peers appear online.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 3
positive relationships. 4 arrows total.

When Notification Frequency is high, what chain reaction does it trigger through Dopamine Release, Screen Time, Social Comparison, and ultimately Self-Esteem Level? Where does the feedback loop trap you?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Notification Frequency is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — LOW NOTIFICATIONS
• Notification Frequency set to low, simulating intentional phone use
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Screen Time and Self-Esteem when the app can't constantly pull you back in?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HIGH NOTIFICATIONS
• Notification Frequency at maximum, simulating default app settings
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the dopamine-screen time loop when notifications bombard you every few minutes?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — GRADUAL ESCALATION
• Notification Frequency slowly increasing over weeks
• PREDICT FIRST: At what point do you predict casual social media use crosses into compulsive, addictive behavior?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Social media platforms exploit the brain's dopamine reward system using the same variable reward schedule as slot machines — unpredictable likes and notifications are more addictive than predictable ones
• A positive feedback loop forms: notifications trigger dopamine, dopamine drives more screen time, more screen time means more social comparison, and lower self-esteem drives users to seek more online validation
• The tipping point from healthy to compulsive use is driven by notification frequency — once the brain is conditioned to expect constant rewards, it becomes difficult to disengage
• Self-esteem erosion is gradual and often invisible to the user, making the damage harder to recognize until it's deeply established in neural pathways

THE ANSWER: You can't put your phone down because social media platforms are engineered to exploit your brain's dopamine reward system. Every notification triggers a small dopamine hit, reinforcing the behavior of checking your phone. The variable timing of likes and comments creates an unpredictable reward schedule — the exact mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. As screen time increases, social comparison intensifies, slowly eroding self-esteem. Lower self-esteem drives you to seek MORE validation online, creating a self-reinforcing loop that literally rewires your brain to crave the next notification.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Low Notifications. Notification Frequency set to low, simulating intentional phone use.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: High Notifications.
Notification Frequency at maximum, simulating default app settings.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to the dopamine-screen time loop when notifications bombard you every few minutes?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Gradual Escalation. Notification Frequency slowly increasing over weeks.
At what point do you predict casual social media use crosses into compulsive, addictive behavior?

Here's what our model reveals: You can't put your phone down because social media platforms are engineered to exploit your brain's dopamine reward system. Every notification triggers a small dopamine hit, reinforcing the behavior of checking your phone. The variable timing of likes and comments creates an unpredictable reward schedule — the exact mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. As screen time increases, social comparison intensifies, slowly eroding self-esteem. Lower self-esteem drives you to seek MORE validation online, creating a self-reinforcing loop that literally rewires your brain to crave the next notification.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Notification Frequency?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Sleep Quality — The number of hours and depth of restorative sleep, which is severely disrupted by blue light exposure and dopamine-driven late-night scrolling, creating a secondary health cascade
   • Anxiety Level — The chronic state of worry and unease amplified by constant social comparison, fear of missing out (FOMO), and the pressure to maintain an online persona
   • Algorithm Intensity — The aggressiveness of the platform's recommendation algorithm, which learns what triggers dopamine release in each individual user and serves increasingly targeted content

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Dopamine Reward Pathway — how does this connect to your model?
   • Variable Reward Schedules — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model explain why social media companies design their apps with variable notification schedules rather than predictable ones?
   • What does the positive feedback loop in your model reveal about why quitting social media feels so difficult?
   • How does the relationship between social comparison and self-esteem create a trap that keeps users engaged?
   • If you could redesign one feature of social media based on your model, what would you change and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 5 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Sleep Quality. The number of hours and depth of restorative sleep, which is severely disrupted by blue light exposure and dopamine-driven late-night scrolling, creating a secondary health cascade
How would you model that?

Anxiety Level. The chronic state of worry and unease amplified by constant social comparison, fear of missing out (FOMO), and the pressure to maintain an online persona
How would you model that?

Algorithm Intensity. The aggressiveness of the platform's recommendation algorithm, which learns what triggers dopamine release in each individual user and serves increasingly targeted content
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: How Social Media Hacks Your Brain
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Your brain evolved over millions of years to seek rewards that helped your ancestors survive — food, social bonding, mating opportunities. Every time you found something rewarding, your brain released dopamine to say 'do that again.' Social media has hijacked this ancient system, delivering hyper-concentrated social rewards at a speed and frequency your brain was never designed to handle.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS1-2: Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model of the brain's dopamine reward system to illustrate how hierarchical biological systems — from neurotransmitters to behavior to mental health — interact across scales.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A: Structure and Function
  The nervous system's hierarchical organization — from neurotransmitter molecules to neural circuits to behavioral patterns — demonstrates how disruption at the molecular level (dopamine dysregulation) cascades to affect the whole organism's functioning and well-being.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students trace the causal chain from external stimulus (notification) to molecular response (dopamine release) to behavioral change (increased screen time) to psychological outcome (self-esteem change), demonstrating multi-level cause and effect.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Dopamine, Variable Reward Schedule, Social Comparison, Neuroplasticity
□ Prepare Why can't you put your phone down — even when you know you should discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify notification frequency, screen time, dopamine release, social comparison, and self-esteem level as the key components of the social media–brain interaction system.
• Establish: Students determine that notifications trigger dopamine release, dopamine drives screen time, screen time enables social comparison, and social comparison erodes self-esteem — forming a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing the positive feedback loop between social media design features and the brain's reward system, and the downstream effects on self-esteem.
• Evaluate: Students run low-notification, high-notification, and gradual escalation scenarios to test their model and identify the tipping point where use becomes compulsive.
• Revise: Students add sleep quality, anxiety level, or algorithm intensity to explore more realistic models of social media's impact on adolescent well-being.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Dopamine Reward Pathway:
  Dopamine is released by neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projects to the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. When you receive a like, comment, or new follower, this pathway activates — the same circuit triggered by food, sex, and drugs. The key insight is that dopamine doesn't just signal pleasure; it signals ANTICIPATION of reward. The buzz of a notification is often more powerful than the actual content, because your brain is responding to the POSSIBILITY of a reward.

• Variable Reward Schedules:
  B.F. Skinner discovered in the 1950s that the most addictive reward pattern is variable ratio reinforcement — rewards that come at unpredictable intervals. Slot machines use this principle: you never know when the next win is coming, so you keep pulling. Social media does the same thing. You don't know which refresh will bring a flood of likes or a disappointing nothing. This unpredictability keeps you checking, because the next time MIGHT be the big payoff.

• Social Comparison Theory:
  Psychologist Leon Festinger proposed in 1954 that humans have a fundamental drive to evaluate themselves by comparing to others. On social media, you're comparing your unfiltered daily life to everyone else's curated highlight reel — their best photos, achievements, and moments. Research shows this 'upward social comparison' consistently decreases self-esteem and life satisfaction, particularly in adolescents whose identity is still forming.

• Neuroplasticity and Digital Habits:
  The brain physically changes in response to repeated experiences — neurons that fire together wire together. Heavy social media use strengthens the neural pathways associated with phone-checking behavior while weakening pathways for sustained attention, delayed gratification, and real-world social skills. Brain imaging studies show that adolescents who use social media heavily have measurable differences in their prefrontal cortex (decision-making) and amygdala (emotion processing) compared to light users.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Social media addiction isn't real — it's just a lack of willpower"
  Reality: Social media platforms are engineered by teams of behavioral psychologists and neuroscientists to be as habit-forming as possible. The same brain circuits activated by social media are activated by gambling and substance use. Brain imaging studies show measurable changes in the prefrontal cortex and reward pathways of heavy social media users. Calling it 'willpower' ignores the neuroscience.
  Strategy: Ask: If a casino designed a slot machine to be maximally addictive and someone couldn't stop playing, would you blame the player or the machine designer?

• "I use social media because I want to — it's my choice"
  Reality: While the initial download is a choice, the continued use is heavily influenced by design features specifically created to bypass conscious decision-making. Variable reward schedules, autoplay, infinite scroll, and notification timing are all optimized through A/B testing to maximize engagement. Your 'choice' is being made in an environment engineered to produce a specific outcome.
  Strategy: Thought experiment: If the grocery store rearranged itself every visit to maximize the time you spend inside, and you always ended up buying more than you planned, is that really free choice?

• "Only weak or lonely people get addicted to social media"
  Reality: Research shows that social media's addictive mechanisms work on ALL brains — the dopamine reward system is universal. In fact, highly social people may be MORE susceptible because they have a stronger need for social feedback. Adolescent brains are particularly vulnerable because the prefrontal cortex (impulse control) isn't fully developed until age 25.
  Strategy: Show the data: 95% of teens use social media. If 'only weak people' were affected, the usage rate would be much lower. The design works on everyone.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why can't you put your phone down — even when you know you should?
Answer: You can't put your phone down because social media platforms are engineered to exploit your brain's dopamine reward system. Every notification triggers a small dopamine hit, reinforcing the behavior of checking your phone. The variable timing of likes and comments creates an unpredictable reward schedule — the exact mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. As screen time increases, social comparison intensifies, slowly eroding self-esteem. Lower self-esteem drives you to seek MORE validation online, creating a self-reinforcing loop that literally rewires your brain to crave the next notification.

Simulation Answers:
• Low Notifications Scenario: When Notification Frequency is low, the dopamine reward cycle activates less often. Screen Time decreases because the brain isn't being constantly pulled back to the app. With less scrolling, Social Comparison diminishes, and Self-Esteem Level remains relatively stable. The model shows that controlling the entry point — notifications — can disrupt the entire addictive loop.
• High Notifications Scenario: When Notification Frequency is at maximum, Dopamine Release spikes repeatedly throughout the day. Screen Time escalates dramatically as the brain's reward pathway is continuously reinforced. Social Comparison intensifies with more feed exposure, and Self-Esteem Level drops progressively. The positive feedback loop becomes self-sustaining — even without notifications, the brain starts checking the app in anticipation of rewards.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is the positive feedback loop so hard to break?
  A: The loop is self-reinforcing at every stage. Lower self-esteem from social comparison drives you to seek validation online (more likes = temporary self-esteem boost), which increases screen time, which exposes you to more comparison content, which further lowers self-esteem. Additionally, neuroplasticity means the brain has physically rewired itself to make phone-checking automatic — it becomes a reflex, not a conscious choice. Breaking the loop requires disrupting it at the entry point (notifications) because once the dopamine cycle starts, the biological drive to continue is extremely powerful.
• Q: What makes variable rewards more addictive than predictable ones?
  A: Predictable rewards — like getting exactly 10 likes on every post — allow the brain to habituate and lose interest. Variable rewards keep the brain in a state of constant anticipation because you never know if the next check will bring 0 likes or 200. This uncertainty is neurologically more stimulating than certainty. The brain releases more dopamine in ANTICIPATION of a possible reward than during the reward itself. This is exactly why slot machines are more addictive than vending machines — both give you something, but only one keeps you guessing.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Digital Wellness App
Mission: Design an app or system that helps teenagers recognize and break the dopamine-driven feedback loop by providing real-time awareness of their usage patterns and emotional state.
Scenario: A school district has reported that 73% of its students spend more than 4 hours daily on social media, with school counselors seeing a 40% increase in anxiety and depression referrals. The superintendent has hired your team to design a digital wellness tool that doesn't just limit screen time, but helps students understand WHY they keep going back and gives them strategies to break the cycle.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A school district is seeing measurable increases in student anxiety and depression linked to social media use. Your team has been hired to design a digital wellness tool that helps students understand the neuroscience behind their phone habits and provides science-based strategies for healthier use patterns.

Key Concepts:
• Behavioral Nudges: Small design interventions that gently redirect behavior without removing choice. Examples include usage timers that show accumulated daily screen time, grayscale mode that removes the visual dopamine trigger of colorful feeds, and 'take a breath' prompts before opening an app.
• Biofeedback Integration: Using physiological data — heart rate variability, screen distance, typing speed — to detect when a user is in a compulsive scrolling state versus intentional use. The system could intervene only when stress indicators suggest harmful patterns.
• Habit Replacement Theory: Neuroscience shows that habits can't simply be eliminated — they must be replaced with alternative behaviors that satisfy the same need. A wellness app might redirect the social connection need from scrolling feeds to messaging a real friend or joining an in-person activity.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design addresses the dopamine loop at multiple points, uses neuroscience evidence from the model, includes personalized detection of compulsive patterns, and provides adaptive interventions that users would actually use
• Proficient (3): Design targets the dopamine loop with reasonable interventions and includes some basis in neuroscience from the model
• Developing (2): Design addresses screen time reduction but doesn't connect strategies to the underlying neuroscience or reward system
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or simply locks the phone without addressing the behavioral and neurological mechanisms

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified diagram of the dopamine reward pathway (VTA → nucleus accumbens → prefrontal cortex) for reference
  • Use real-world analogies: notification bell = slot machine lever, likes = variable jackpot, infinite scroll = no exit sign
  • Sentence frames: 'When notification frequency increases, dopamine release __ because __, which causes screen time to __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the internal documents leaked by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen showing the company knew Instagram harmed teen mental health — analyze the ethical implications
  • Investigate how different social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat) use different variable reward mechanisms and compare their addictive potential
  • Design an experiment to test whether turning off notifications for one week measurably affects mood and screen time — then actually run it

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Analyze screen time data: Calculate the percentage of waking hours spent on social media and create statistical models predicting screen time based on notification frequency
  • ELA: Write a persuasive argument for or against government regulation of addictive design features in social media platforms targeting minors
  • Social Studies: Research the history of addictive product design — from cigarettes to slot machines to social media — and analyze how societies have responded to protect consumers

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model how the brain's dopamine reward system creates a positive feedback loop with social media notifications
• Analyze the hierarchical relationship between neurotransmitter activity, behavioral patterns, and psychological well-being
• Predict how changes to notification design could disrupt or reinforce the addictive feedback loop

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A student turns off all push notifications on their social media apps but still checks them manually every 15 minutes. According to your model, which component is most responsible for maintaining the compulsive behavior?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain the complete causal chain from a single Instagram notification to a measurable decrease in self-esteem. Identify every component involved and whether each relationship is positive or negative.

PRE-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. How many hours per day do you spend on social media, and how does it make you feel after using it?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. Why do you think it's so hard to stop scrolling even when you know you should do something else?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. What do you think happens in your brain when you get a like or comment on your post?

   _________________________________________________________

VOCABULARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Match the term to the definition:

___ Dopamine                      
___ Variable Reward Schedule      
___ Social Comparison             
___ Neuroplasticity               

A. A neurotransmitter that acts as the brain's reward chemical — released during pleasurable activities like eating, socializing, and receiving likes on social media, reinforcing behaviors that triggered its release
B. A pattern where rewards (likes, comments, notifications) arrive at unpredictable intervals — the same mechanism used in slot machines — which is far more addictive than predictable rewards
C. The psychological process of evaluating your own worth, appearance, or success by comparing yourself to others — amplified by curated social media feeds showing highlight reels of other people's lives
D. The brain's ability to physically rewire itself based on repeated experiences — meaning habitual phone use literally reshapes neural pathways to crave more screen time
