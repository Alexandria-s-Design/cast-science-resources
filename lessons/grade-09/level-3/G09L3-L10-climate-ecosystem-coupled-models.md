### Title
**Climate-Ecosystem Coupled Models — Modeling Feedback Loops Between Climate Change, Ecosystems, and Human Society**

### Overview
This lesson introduces students to coupled climate-ecosystem modeling — the integration of atmospheric physics, ocean chemistry, terrestrial ecology, and human systems into a single interconnected model. Biotech skill focus: Multi-system feedback analysis and tipping point dynamics. Understanding the Earth as a coupled system is essential for making evidence-based decisions about climate mitigation and adaptation. Students investigate the driving question: Climate change doesn't just heat the planet — it triggers cascading feedback loops through every ecosystem on Earth. When permafrost melts and releases methane, which accelerates warming, which melts more permafrost, which releases more methane — how do you model a system where the output becomes the input? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 3: Biotech

### NGSS Standard
**HS-ESS3-5, HS-LS2-6**: Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change; evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem.

### Learning Objectives
- Build a coupled climate-ecosystem model that traces feedback loops between atmospheric CO2, temperature, ocean absorption, permafrost methane release, and biological carbon sequestration
- Analyze how positive and negative feedback loops create tipping points, runaway effects, and nonlinear system behavior in the Earth's climate-ecosystem system
- Predict the cascading consequences of climate change across ecological, agricultural, and societal systems using multi-variable simulation
- Evaluate the effectiveness and trade-offs of different adaptation and mitigation strategies using model-derived evidence

### Component List (Starting Model: 10 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Atmospheric CO2 | External | The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, measured in parts per million (ppm) — currently ~425 ppm and rising approximately 2.5 ppm/year due to fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes, driving the greenhouse effect that warms the planet |
| Global Temperature | Internal | The average surface temperature of the Earth relative to pre-industrial levels — currently approximately 1.2 degrees C above pre-industrial baseline, with projections of 1.5-4.5 degrees C increase by 2100 depending on emission trajectories |
| Ocean Absorption | Internal | The rate at which the ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and heat from the climate system — the ocean has absorbed approximately 30% of anthropogenic CO2 and over 90% of excess heat, but absorption capacity decreases as the ocean warms and acidifies |
| Permafrost Methane Release | Internal | The rate at which thawing Arctic permafrost releases trapped methane (CH4) and CO2 — permafrost contains approximately 1,500 gigatons of organic carbon (twice the current atmospheric carbon), and methane is 80x more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over 20 years |
| Forest Carbon Sequestration | Internal | The net rate at which global forests absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis minus the rate they release it through respiration, decomposition, and fire — currently forests absorb approximately 2.6 gigatons of CO2 per year, but this sink is declining as forests face heat stress, drought, fire, and deforestation |
| Species Migration Rate | Internal | The speed at which plant and animal species shift their geographic ranges in response to changing climate conditions — many species must move poleward or to higher elevations to maintain suitable habitat, but migration speed is limited by dispersal ability, habitat fragmentation, and physical barriers |
| Crop Yield Change | Internal | The percentage change in global agricultural productivity resulting from temperature increases, altered precipitation patterns, increased CO2 fertilization, and changing pest and disease pressure — moderate warming may benefit some crops temporarily while severe warming reduces yields for most staple crops |
| Sea Level Rise | Internal | The increase in global mean sea level caused by thermal expansion of ocean water and melting of land-based ice (glaciers, Greenland, and Antarctic ice sheets) — currently rising approximately 3.6 mm/year and accelerating, with 0.5-2.0 meters projected by 2100 |
| Extreme Weather Frequency | Internal | The rate of occurrence of extreme weather events (hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires) relative to historical baselines — warmer atmosphere holds 7% more water vapor per degree C of warming, intensifying the hydrological cycle and amplifying weather extremes |
| Societal Adaptation Capacity | External | The ability of human societies to adjust to climate change impacts through infrastructure, technology, policy, economic resources, and institutional capacity — wealthy nations can build sea walls and develop drought-resistant crops while vulnerable nations face disproportionate climate risk with fewer resources to adapt |

CLIMATE-ECOSYSTEM COUPLED MODELS

Modeling Feedback Loops Between Climate Change, Ecosystems, and Human Society.
Climate change doesn't just heat the planet — it triggers cascading feedback loops through every ecosystem on Earth. When permafrost melts and releases methane, which accelerates warming, which melts more permafrost, which releases more methane — how do you model a system where the output becomes the input?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Atmospheric CO2" — the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
  ○ Click "Societal Adaptation Capacity" — the ability of human societies to adjust to climate change impacts through infrastructure
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Global Temperature" — the average surface temperature of the earth relative to pre-industrial levels — currently approximately 1
  ○ Click "Ocean Absorption" — the rate at which the ocean absorbs co2 from the atmosphere and heat from the climate system — the ocean has absorbed approximately 30% of anthropogenic co2 and over 90% of excess heat
  ○ Click "Permafrost Methane Release" — the rate at which thawing arctic permafrost releases trapped methane (ch4) and co2 — permafrost contains approximately 1
  ○ Click "Forest Carbon Sequestration" — the net rate at which global forests absorb co2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis minus the rate they release it through respiration
  ○ Click "Species Migration Rate" — the speed at which plant and animal species shift their geographic ranges in response to changing climate conditions — many species must move poleward or to higher elevations to maintain suitable habitat

  ○ Click "Extreme Weather Frequency" — the rate of occurrence of extreme weather events (hurricanes

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 10 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL

"Climate change doesn't just heat the planet — it triggers cascading feedback loops through every ecosystem on Earth. When permafrost melts and releases methane, which accelerates warming, which melts more permafrost, which releases more methane — how do you model a system where the output becomes the input?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Atmospheric CO2' — that's external. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, measured in parts per million (ppm) — currently ~425 ppm and rising approximately 2.
Click on 'Global Temperature' — that's internal. The average surface temperature of the Earth relative to pre-industrial levels — currently approximately 1.
Click on 'Ocean Absorption' — that's internal. The rate at which the ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and heat from the climate system — the ocean has absorbed approximately 30% of anthropogenic CO2 and over 90% of excess heat.
Click on 'Permafrost Methane Release' — that's internal. The rate at which thawing Arctic permafrost releases trapped methane (CH4) and CO2 — permafrost contains approximately 1.
Click on 'Forest Carbon Sequestration' — that's internal. The net rate at which global forests absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis minus the rate they release it through respiration, decomposition, and fire — currently forests absorb approximately 2.
Click on 'Species Migration Rate' — that's internal. The speed at which plant and animal species shift their geographic ranges in response to changing climate conditions — many species must move poleward or to higher elevations to maintain suitable habitat.
Click on 'Crop Yield Change' — that's internal. The percentage change in global agricultural productivity resulting from temperature increases.
Click on 'Sea Level Rise' — that's internal. The increase in global mean sea level caused by thermal expansion of ocean water and melting of land-based ice (glaciers, Greenland, and Antarctic ice sheets) — currently rising approximately 3.
Click on 'Extreme Weather Frequency' — that's internal. The rate of occurrence of extreme weather events (hurricanes.
Click on 'Societal Adaptation Capacity' — that's external. The ability of human societies to adjust to climate change impacts through infrastructure.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Atmospheric CO2 and Societal Adaptation Capacity are the two external components. Atmospheric CO2 is the primary driver — determined by human emission decisions, which are policy and technology choices, not intrinsic properties of the climate system. Societal Adaptation Capacity is also external — determined by economic investment, technological development, policy decisions, and institutional capacity, not by the climate system itself. All other eight components are internal responses: Global Temperature, Ocean Absorption, Permafrost Methane Release, Forest Carbon Sequestration, Species Migration Rate, Crop Yield Change, Sea Level Rise, and Extreme Weather Frequency emerge from the physics, chemistry, biology, and geography of the Earth system responding to the CO2 forcing.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 10 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Atmospheric CO2" and drag an arrow to "Global Temperature"
• Click on "Global Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Ocean Absorption"
• Click on "Global Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Permafrost Methane Release"
• Click on "Forest Carbon Sequestration" and drag an arrow to "Atmospheric CO2"
• Click on "Global Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Extreme Weather Frequency"
• Click on "Extreme Weather Frequency" and drag an arrow to "Societal Adaptation Capacity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Atmospheric CO2 → Global Temperature = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher atmospheric CO2 traps more outgoing infrared radiation through the greenhouse effect, increasing the planet's energy imbalance and raising Global Temperature — each doubling of CO2 produces approximately 3 degrees C of equilibrium warming (climate sensitivity).

  ○ Global Temperature → Ocean Absorption = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher temperatures reduce the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 because warm water holds less dissolved gas (Henry's Law) and because warming stratifies the ocean, reducing mixing between surface and deep layers that sequester carbon long-term.

  ○ Global Temperature → Permafrost Methane Release = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher temperatures thaw Arctic permafrost, exposing frozen organic matter to microbial decomposition that releases CO2 and methane — this is a POSITIVE FEEDBACK because the released greenhouse gases cause additional warming that thaws more permafrost.

  ○ Forest Carbon Sequestration → Atmospheric CO2 = NEGATIVE (−)
    Greater forest growth and photosynthesis remove more CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing the atmospheric concentration — this is a NEGATIVE FEEDBACK that partially counteracts emissions, but it can reverse at high temperatures when forests die and release stored carbon.

  ○ Global Temperature → Extreme Weather Frequency = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher temperatures intensify the hydrological cycle (warmer air holds 7% more water vapor per degree C), increase ocean heat content that fuels tropical storms, and create more extreme temperature events — all increasing the frequency and intensity of weather extremes.

  ○ Extreme Weather Frequency → Societal Adaptation Capacity = NEGATIVE (−)
    More frequent extreme weather events damage infrastructure, displace populations, destroy crops, and consume disaster response resources, progressively degrading a society's capacity to adapt to ongoing and future climate impacts.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 6 arrows total
• 3 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: This model is fundamentally different from the others because it contains MULTIPLE feedback loops — and some of them are positive (self-amplifying). Atmospheric CO2 increases Global Temperature through the greenhouse effect. Higher temperature reduces Ocean Absorption capacity (warm water holds less CO2). Higher temperature thaws Permafrost, which releases more greenhouse gases, which increases Global Temperature further — a classic positive feedback loop. But higher CO2 also increases photosynthesis (CO2 fertilization), which increases Forest Carbon Sequestration — a negative feedback that partially counteracts the warming. Meanwhile, higher temperatures cause Species Migration, Crop Yield Change, Sea Level Rise, and Extreme Weather Frequency — all of which affect Societal Adaptation Capacity, which determines whether human societies can respond effectively. The question isn't just 'how much will it warm?' — it's 'when do we cross tipping points where the feedbacks become self-sustaining regardless of what we do?'

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Atmospheric CO2' and drag an arrow
over to 'Global Temperature.'

Here's the key question: When atmospheric co2 goes UP, does
global temperature go UP or DOWN?

Higher atmospheric CO2 traps more outgoing infrared radiation through the greenhouse effect, increasing the planet's energy imbalance and raising Global Temperature — each doubling of CO2 produces approximately 3 degrees C of equilibrium warming (climate sensitivity).
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Global Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ocean Absorption.'

Here's the key question: When global temperature goes UP, does
ocean absorption go UP or DOWN?

Higher temperatures reduce the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 because warm water holds less dissolved gas (Henry's Law) and because warming stratifies the ocean, reducing mixing between surface and deep layers that sequester carbon long-term.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Global Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Permafrost Methane Release.'

Here's the key question: When global temperature goes UP, does
permafrost methane release go UP or DOWN?

Higher temperatures thaw Arctic permafrost, exposing frozen organic matter to microbial decomposition that releases CO2 and methane — this is a POSITIVE FEEDBACK because the released greenhouse gases cause additional warming that thaws more permafrost.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Forest Carbon Sequestration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Atmospheric CO2.'

Here's the key question: When forest carbon sequestration goes UP, does
atmospheric co2 go UP or DOWN?

Greater forest growth and photosynthesis remove more CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing the atmospheric concentration — this is a NEGATIVE FEEDBACK that partially counteracts emissions, but it can reverse at high temperatures when forests die and release stored carbon.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Global Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Extreme Weather Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When global temperature goes UP, does
extreme weather frequency go UP or DOWN?

Higher temperatures intensify the hydrological cycle (warmer air holds 7% more water vapor per degree C), increase ocean heat content that fuels tropical storms, and create more extreme temperature events — all increasing the frequency and intensity of weather extremes.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Extreme Weather Frequency' and drag an arrow
over to 'Societal Adaptation Capacity.'

Here's the key question: When extreme weather frequency goes UP, does
societal adaptation capacity go UP or DOWN?

More frequent extreme weather events damage infrastructure, displace populations, destroy crops, and consume disaster response resources, progressively degrading a society's capacity to adapt to ongoing and future climate impacts.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 3 negative and 3
positive relationships. 6 arrows total.

This model is fundamentally different from the others because it contains MULTIPLE feedback loops — and some of them are positive (self-amplifying). Atmospheric CO2 increases Global Temperature through the greenhouse effect. Higher temperature reduces Ocean Absorption capacity (warm water holds less CO2).

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Atmospheric CO2 is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — PARIS COMPLIANCE
• Limited warming to 1.5-2.0 degrees C
• PREDICT FIRST: At 1.5 degrees C warming, which ecosystem impacts do you predict are still unavoidable even with aggressive emission reductions?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — BUSINESS-AS-USUAL
• High emission trajectory, 3-4 degrees C warming
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Permafrost Methane Release and Forest Carbon Sequestration when Global Temperature reaches 3 degrees C above pre-industrial?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — TIPPING POINT SEARCH
• Gradual temperature increase
• PREDICT FIRST: At what Global Temperature do you predict the permafrost positive feedback loop becomes self-sustaining — adding more warming than emission reductions can offset?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The climate system contains multiple positive feedback loops that can amplify warming beyond what CO2 emissions alone would produce — permafrost methane release, reduced ocean absorption, and forest die-off can each become self-reinforcing above critical temperature thresholds
• Forest Carbon Sequestration is a negative feedback that partially counteracts warming, but it has a tipping point — above approximately 2.5-3.0 degrees C of warming, widespread forest die-off from heat stress, drought, and wildfire converts forests from carbon sinks to carbon sources, flipping the feedback from negative to positive
• Sea Level Rise and Extreme Weather Frequency are lagging indicators — they continue to accelerate for decades after emissions peak because of thermal inertia in the ocean and committed ice sheet melting, meaning current commitments have already locked in significant future impacts
• Societal Adaptation Capacity is the most unequally distributed component — nations that have contributed the least to atmospheric CO2 (sub-Saharan Africa, South Pacific island nations) face the most severe impacts with the fewest resources to adapt, creating a fundamental climate justice challenge

THE ANSWER: Climate change is not a simple linear process — it's a complex system of interacting feedback loops that connect atmospheric chemistry, ocean physics, terrestrial ecology, and human society. The ten components of this coupled model reveal the cascading nature of climate impacts: Atmospheric CO2 drives Global Temperature through the greenhouse effect, but the response is amplified by positive feedback loops (permafrost methane release, reduced ocean absorption capacity, forest die-off) and partially counteracted by negative feedbacks (ocean absorption, forest sequestration, CO2 fertilization). These feedbacks create tipping points — critical thresholds beyond which the system transitions to a new state regardless of future human action. The downstream consequences — Species Migration Rate, Crop Yield Change, Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather Frequency — cascade through ecological and societal systems in ways that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. Societal Adaptation Capacity determines whether communities survive these impacts, but adaptation has limits — no amount of adaptation can compensate for a fundamentally destabilized climate system. The model demonstrates that early, aggressive emission reduction is not just environmentally preferable but mathematically necessary to avoid crossing irreversible tipping points.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Paris Compliance. Limited warming to 1.5-2.0 degrees C.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Business-As-Usual.
High emission trajectory, 3-4 degrees C warming.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Permafrost Methane Release and Forest Carbon Sequestration when Global Temperature reaches 3 degrees C above pre-industrial?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Tipping Point Search. Gradual temperature increase.
At what Global Temperature do you predict the permafrost positive feedback loop becomes self-sustaining — adding more warming than emission reductions can offset?

Here's what our model reveals: Climate change is not a simple linear process — it's a complex system of interacting feedback loops that connect atmospheric chemistry, ocean physics, terrestrial ecology, and human society.

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Atmospheric CO2?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Societal Adaptation Capacity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Albedo Feedback — The reflectivity change caused by melting ice and snow cover — ice reflects 80-90% of solar radiation while open ocean absorbs 90%, creating a powerful positive feedback where ice loss causes more warming which causes more ice loss, particularly important in the Arctic where summer sea ice has declined 40% since 1979
   • Ocean Acidification — The decrease in ocean pH caused by dissolved CO2 reacting with water to form carbonic acid — currently 30% more acidic than pre-industrial levels, threatening coral reefs, shellfish, and marine food webs, with cascading effects on ocean carbon absorption capacity and marine ecosystem stability
   • Climate Migration Pressure — The displacement of human populations by climate impacts including sea level rise, extreme heat, drought, and agricultural collapse — currently 20+ million climate-displaced people annually, projected to reach 200+ million by 2050, creating political, economic, and humanitarian cascading effects

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Carbon Cycle and Climate System — how does this connect to your model?
   • Positive Feedback Loops and Tipping Points — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your model demonstrate the difference between positive feedback loops (self-amplifying) and negative feedback loops (self-correcting) in the climate system — and why are the positive feedbacks winning?
   • What did the tipping point analysis reveal about the relationship between Global Temperature and Permafrost Methane Release — and why is this threshold so consequential?
   • Why does Forest Carbon Sequestration potentially flip from a negative feedback (absorbing CO2) to a positive feedback (releasing CO2) above a certain temperature threshold?
   • How would adding Climate Migration Pressure to your model change the analysis of Societal Adaptation Capacity?

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 10 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Albedo Feedback. The reflectivity change caused by melting ice and snow cover — ice reflects 80-90% of solar radiation while open ocean absorbs 90%, creating a powerful positive feedback where ice loss causes more warming which causes more ice loss, particularly important in the Arctic where summer sea ice has declined 40% since 1979
How would you model that?

Ocean Acidification. The decrease in ocean pH caused by dissolved CO2 reacting with water to form carbonic acid — currently 30% more acidic than pre-industrial levels, threatening coral reefs, shellfish, and marine food webs, with cascading effects on ocean carbon absorption capacity and marine ecosystem stability
How would you model that?

Climate Migration Pressure. The displacement of human populations by climate impacts including sea level rise, extreme heat, drought, and agricultural collapse — currently 20+ million climate-displaced people annually, projected to reach 200+ million by 2050, creating political, economic, and humanitarian cascading effects
How would you model that?

Say: "Climate change doesn't just warm the planet. It triggers cascading feedback loops that can accelerate warming beyond our control. When permafrost melts and releases methane, which causes more warming, which melts more permafrost — that's a feedback loop. And some of them have tipping points."
Do: Display before/after images of Arctic ice, coral reefs, and forests. Let the scale of change register before proceeding.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 2: LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Visual: Learning goals with climate and systems vocabulary
Say: "Today you're Earth system scientists. You're going to model the most complex system we've covered — the entire planet. Ten components, multiple feedback loops, and tipping points that could change everything."
Do: Pre-teach positive feedback loop and tipping point. Use the analogy: a positive feedback is like a snowball rolling downhill, getting bigger and faster; a tipping point is the edge of the cliff.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 3: BIG QUESTION
Visual: When do climate feedbacks become self-sustaining?
Say: "Here's the terrifying question: Is there a point where climate change becomes self-sustaining — where even if we stopped all emissions tomorrow, the feedbacks would keep warming the planet? That's the tipping point question. Let's find out."
Do: Think-pair-share: Students brainstorm what 'self-sustaining feedback' means in the climate system. What processes could cause warming to continue even after emissions stop? Collect and categorize ideas.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 4: LEVER FRAMEWORK
Visual: LEVER steps with coupled climate-ecosystem context
Say: "We're coupling multiple systems — atmosphere, ocean, land, ecosystems, agriculture, and human society — into a single model. The output of each system becomes the input of another. This is what real climate models do."
Do: Preview LEVER steps. Emphasize that this model has multiple feedback LOOPS, not just linear chains — outputs circle back to modify inputs.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS
Visual: Ten component cards spanning atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and societal systems
Say: "Two of these components are under human control. Eight are responses. But some of those responses loop BACK to amplify or dampen the original driver. Find the feedback loops."
Do: Guide sorting of external (Atmospheric CO2, Societal Adaptation Capacity) versus internal components. Then identify which internal components feed BACK to influence others — mapping the positive and negative feedback loops.
Time: 8 min

SLIDE 6: ACTIVITY 2: CONNECTIONS
Visual: Coupled model diagram with positive and negative feedback loops explicitly marked
Say: "The permafrost-methane-warming loop is the scariest positive feedback in the entire climate system. 1,500 gigatons of frozen carbon — twice what's currently in the atmosphere — waiting to be released if we warm the Arctic enough. Draw this loop."
Do: Students trace each feedback loop: CO2 to temperature to permafrost to more CO2 (positive), CO2 to temperature to forest growth to less CO2 (negative, until tipping point). Identify which feedbacks are winning.
Time: 8 min

SLIDE 7: ACTIVITY 3: SIMULATION
Visual: Climate projections under three emission scenarios with feedback loop dynamics
Say: "Run the three scenarios. In Paris compliance, can you keep the feedbacks manageable? In business-as-usual, what breaks first? And in the tipping point analysis — find the temperature where the permafrost feedback becomes unstoppable."
Do: Students predict, then simulate. The tipping point analysis is the key discovery — finding the temperature threshold where the system crosses from reversible to irreversible. Discuss what this means for climate policy urgency.
Time: 10 min

SLIDE 8: DISCOVERIES
Visual: Key climate system insights, tipping point thresholds, and adaptation requirements

TEACHER GUIDE: Climate-Ecosystem Coupled Models
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson introduces students to coupled climate-ecosystem modeling — the integration of atmospheric physics, ocean chemistry, terrestrial ecology, and human systems into a single interconnected model. Biotech skill focus: Multi-system feedback analysis and tipping point dynamics. Understanding the Earth as a coupled system is essential for making evidence-based decisions about climate mitigation and adaptation.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-ESS3-5, HS-LS2-6: Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change; evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models / Analyzing and Interpreting Data
  Students develop a coupled climate-ecosystem model with multiple interacting feedback loops, analyzing data from simulations to identify tipping points and project cascading consequences across natural and human systems.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.D Global Climate Change / LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
  Human activities affect global climate through greenhouse gas emissions; ecosystems respond to climate disruption through species migration, productivity changes, and potential collapse when adaptation limits are exceeded.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change / Cause and Effect
  Students analyze how positive and negative feedback loops determine whether the climate-ecosystem system maintains stability or undergoes irreversible transitions, tracing causal chains across atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and societal systems.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Positive Feedback Loop, Carbon Sequestration, Tipping Point, Coupled Model
□ Prepare Climate change doesn't just heat the planet — it triggers cascading feedback loops through every ecosystem on Earth. When permafrost melts and releases methane, which accelerates warming, which melts more permafrost, which releases more methane — how do you model a system where the output becomes the input discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify ten components spanning atmospheric drivers (Atmospheric CO2), climate responses (Global Temperature, Ocean Absorption, Permafrost Methane Release), ecosystem responses (Forest Carbon Sequestration, Species Migration Rate), human system impacts (Crop Yield Change, Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather Frequency), and societal capacity (Societal Adaptation Capacity).
• Establish: Students determine that Atmospheric CO2 and Societal Adaptation Capacity are the two primary external inputs — one representing the driver of climate change (controllable through emission policy) and the other representing humanity's capacity to respond (controllable through investment, policy, and technology). All other eight components emerge as interconnected responses with critical feedback loops.
• Visualize: Students build a coupled climate-ecosystem model with explicit positive and negative feedback loops, visualizing how warming cascades through atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and societal systems with nonlinear dynamics and potential tipping points.
• Evaluate: Students run Paris-compliant, business-as-usual, and tipping-point-analysis scenarios to discover the temperature thresholds where positive feedbacks become self-sustaining and cascading consequences become unavoidable.
• Revise: Students add Albedo Feedback, Ocean Acidification, or Climate Migration Pressure to explore additional feedback loops and cascading consequences that increase model realism.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Carbon Cycle and Climate System:
  The Earth's climate is regulated by the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases — primarily CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor — trap outgoing radiation, warming the surface. The carbon cycle moves carbon between four major reservoirs: the atmosphere (approximately 880 GtC), the ocean (approximately 38,000 GtC), terrestrial biomass and soil (approximately 4,000 GtC), and fossil fuels (approximately 10,000 GtC). Human activity has transferred approximately 440 GtC from the fossil fuel reservoir to the atmosphere since 1750, increasing atmospheric CO2 from 280 to 425 ppm. The ocean and terrestrial biosphere have absorbed approximately half of these emissions — but their absorption capacity is declining as the system warms.

• Positive Feedback Loops and Tipping Points:
  Several positive feedback loops in the climate system can amplify warming beyond what greenhouse gas emissions alone would produce. The ice-albedo feedback: warming melts reflective ice, exposing dark ocean or land that absorbs more solar radiation, causing more warming. The permafrost carbon feedback: warming thaws Arctic permafrost containing 1,500 GtC of frozen organic matter, releasing CO2 and methane as it decomposes, causing more warming. The water vapor feedback: warming evaporates more water, and water vapor is a greenhouse gas, causing more warming (this is the single largest amplifying feedback). The forest die-off feedback: extreme warming causes drought, heat stress, and wildfire that kill forests, releasing stored carbon and eliminating future sequestration capacity. Each feedback has a potential tipping point — a temperature threshold beyond which it becomes self-sustaining regardless of future emission reductions.

• Ecosystem Responses to Climate Change:
  Ecosystems respond to climate change through three primary mechanisms. Migration: species shift their ranges poleward (average 17 km per decade for terrestrial species) or to higher elevations (11 m per decade) to track suitable climate conditions. Adaptation: populations with genetic variation may evolve tolerance to new conditions over generations — but the rate of current climate change far exceeds the rate at which most species can adapt genetically. Collapse: when species cannot migrate fast enough or adapt, populations decline and ecosystems reorganize — coral reef bleaching (affecting 75% of global reefs), boreal forest die-off, and savanna desertification are already underway. Agricultural systems face the same pressures: moderate warming (1-2 degrees C) may increase yields for some temperate crops through longer growing seasons and CO2 fertilization, but warming beyond 2-3 degrees C reduces yields for most staple crops (wheat: -6% per degree C, corn: -7.4% per degree C globally).

• Climate Justice and Adaptation Inequality:
  Climate change impacts are profoundly unequal. The nations that have contributed the most cumulative CO2 emissions (US, EU, China) are generally wealthier and better equipped to adapt — with resources for sea walls, disaster response, crop insurance, and technological innovation. The nations that have contributed the least (sub-Saharan Africa, South Pacific islands, Southeast Asia) face the most severe impacts — sea level rise threatening low-lying nations, extreme heat reducing agricultural productivity, and intensified tropical storms — with the fewest resources to adapt. This asymmetry between responsibility and vulnerability is the central challenge of climate justice. The model's Societal Adaptation Capacity component makes this inequality visible: a 0.5-meter sea level rise is manageable for the Netherlands (which has centuries of flood engineering expertise and trillions of dollars of GDP) but existential for Tuvalu (population 12,000, maximum elevation 4.6 meters, GDP $63 million).

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Climate change is a gradual, linear process that we can slowly adjust to"
  Reality: The model reveals that climate change contains TIPPING POINTS — critical thresholds beyond which the system shifts abruptly to a new state. These transitions are nonlinear, meaning the relationship between cause (CO2 emissions) and effect (climate impacts) is not proportional. A small additional temperature increase near a tipping point can trigger dramatically larger consequences than the same increase at lower temperatures. The permafrost methane feedback, ice sheet collapse, and forest die-off all have tipping point characteristics. This means that 'wait and see' approaches to climate policy risk crossing irreversible thresholds.
  Strategy: Analogy: Imagine heating a pot of water. Temperature rises linearly until 100 degrees C — then the system abruptly transitions from liquid to gas. Climate tipping points are similar — gradual change until a threshold, then abrupt system shift. What's different: you can cool the water back down, but you can't easily refreeze 1,500 gigatons of permafrost.

• "Technology will solve climate change so we don't need to reduce emissions"
  Reality: While technology is essential — renewable energy, carbon capture, energy storage — no technology can reverse the effects of positive feedback loops that have already been triggered. The model shows that once Permafrost Methane Release becomes self-sustaining, no amount of direct air carbon capture (currently removing approximately 0.01 Mt CO2/year) can compensate for the approximately 1-2 Gt CO2-equivalent/year of additional emissions. Technology COMPLEMENTS emission reduction — it cannot REPLACE it. The math is simple: we emit approximately 40 Gt CO2/year; the most optimistic carbon capture projections remove approximately 10 Gt CO2/year by 2050; we need to reduce emissions AND deploy capture simultaneously.
  Strategy: Calculate: Current global emissions are approximately 40 GtCO2/year. The largest direct air capture plant removes 36,000 tons/year. How many of these plants would you need to offset current emissions? (Answer: over 1 million.) How much would this cost at $600/ton? (Answer: $24 trillion/year — roughly 25% of global GDP.)

• "Climate change only affects polar bears and distant future generations"
  Reality: The model's downstream components (Crop Yield Change, Extreme Weather Frequency, Sea Level Rise) demonstrate that climate change is affecting human systems NOW — 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, extreme weather events have increased 5x since the 1970s, and agricultural disruptions are already reducing food security in vulnerable regions. Sea Level Rise is displacing communities in the Marshall Islands, Bangladesh, and Louisiana TODAY. The model shows that the impacts accelerate over time, meaning every year of delay in emission reduction commits future generations to worse outcomes. This is not a distant, abstract problem — it is a present, concrete reality with measurable human costs.
  Strategy: Evidence: 2023 saw record global temperatures, Canadian wildfires that blanketed US cities in smoke, Mediterranean heat waves exceeding 48 degrees C, and flooding in Libya that killed 11,000 people. These are model predictions becoming measured reality.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Climate change doesn't just heat the planet — it triggers cascading feedback loops through every ecosystem on Earth. When permafrost melts and releases methane, which accelerates warming, which melts more permafrost, which releases more methane — how do you model a system where the output becomes the input?
Answer: Climate change is not a simple linear process — it's a complex system of interacting feedback loops that connect atmospheric chemistry, ocean physics, terrestrial ecology, and human society. The ten components of this coupled model reveal the cascading nature of climate impacts: Atmospheric CO2 drives Global Temperature through the greenhouse effect, but the response is amplified by positive feedback loops (permafrost methane release, reduced ocean absorption capacity, forest die-off) and partially counteracted by negative feedbacks (ocean absorption, forest sequestration, CO2 fertilization). These feedbacks create tipping points — critical thresholds beyond which the system transitions to a new state regardless of future human action. The downstream consequences — Species Migration Rate, Crop Yield Change, Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather Frequency — cascade through ecological and societal systems in ways that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. Societal Adaptation Capacity determines whether communities survive these impacts, but adaptation has limits — no amount of adaptation can compensate for a fundamentally destabilized climate system. The model demonstrates that early, aggressive emission reduction is not just environmentally preferable but mathematically necessary to avoid crossing irreversible tipping points.

Simulation Answers:
• Paris Agreement Compliance Scenario: With emissions limited to keep warming below 2.0 degrees C, the model shows that most feedback loops remain manageable. Permafrost Methane Release is activated but remains below the self-sustaining threshold. Ocean Absorption continues at reduced capacity. Forest Carbon Sequestration is stressed but maintains net negative carbon flux. However, even at 1.5-2.0 degrees C, significant impacts are unavoidable: Sea Level Rise of 0.3-0.6 meters is committed from thermal expansion and committed ice loss, Extreme Weather Frequency increases 20-30% above baseline, and coral reefs face severe bleaching. Societal Adaptation Capacity must be actively strengthened for vulnerable regions.
• Tipping Point Analysis Scenario: As Global Temperature gradually increases, the model reveals critical thresholds. At approximately 1.5-2.0 degrees C, Arctic summer sea ice disappears seasonally (albedo feedback fully activates). At approximately 2.0-3.0 degrees C, Permafrost Methane Release approaches the self-sustaining threshold where it adds 0.3-0.5 degrees C of warming independent of human emissions. At approximately 3.0-4.0 degrees C, Forest Carbon Sequestration reverses as widespread die-off converts forests from sinks to sources. The model demonstrates that these are not independent thresholds — crossing one tipping point makes crossing others more likely through cascading feedbacks, creating the potential for a 'tipping cascade' that pushes the system to a fundamentally different climate state.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: What makes positive feedback loops so dangerous in the climate system?
  A: The model reveals that positive feedback loops amplify change — small perturbations grow larger over time instead of being dampened. In the climate system, this means that a moderate amount of warming from CO2 emissions can trigger self-reinforcing processes (permafrost methane release, ice-albedo feedback, forest die-off) that produce ADDITIONAL warming beyond what the emissions alone would cause. The critical danger is tipping points: if a positive feedback loop becomes self-sustaining, it will continue to drive change even if the original perturbation (CO2 emissions) is removed. This is analogous to pushing a boulder uphill — you can stop pushing and it stays put (negative feedback), or you can push it past the hilltop and it rolls down the other side on its own (positive feedback past tipping point).
• Q: Why is Societal Adaptation Capacity so unequally distributed?
  A: The model exposes a profound injustice: the nations that have contributed the most to Atmospheric CO2 (historically, the US and Europe; currently, China) generally have the highest Societal Adaptation Capacity — robust infrastructure, diversified economies, advanced technology, and strong institutions. The nations that have contributed the least (sub-Saharan Africa, South Pacific islands, low-lying South Asian countries) have the lowest Societal Adaptation Capacity and face the most severe impacts (sea level rise, extreme heat, agricultural disruption). This means that climate change transfers risk from those who caused it to those who didn't — a fundamental violation of fairness. Addressing this inequality through climate finance, technology transfer, and adaptation support is as essential as emission reductions.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Regional Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Plan
Mission: Design an integrated climate adaptation and mitigation strategy for a specific vulnerable region, using model-derived evidence to prioritize interventions and project outcomes.
Scenario: A coastal city of 2 million people is projected to face 0.5-1.5 meters of sea level rise, a 40% increase in extreme weather events, and significant agricultural disruption by 2080. The city has hired your climate planning team to develop a 50-year integrated strategy that combines mitigation (reducing the city's carbon footprint), adaptation (preparing for unavoidable impacts), and resilience (ensuring recovery from extreme events). Your plan must be evidence-based, economically feasible, and equitable.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A coastal city of 2 million people faces projected sea level rise of 0.5-1.5 meters, a 40% increase in extreme weather, and significant agricultural disruption by 2080. Your climate planning team will design a 50-year integrated strategy combining mitigation (reducing emissions), adaptation (preparing for unavoidable impacts), and resilience (ensuring recovery from extreme events).

Key Concepts:
• Integrated Mitigation-Adaptation Planning: Effective climate strategy requires BOTH reducing the driver (mitigation: cutting emissions, increasing carbon sequestration) AND preparing for the impacts that are already locked in (adaptation: sea walls, drought-resistant crops, early warning systems). Neither alone is sufficient: mitigation without adaptation ignores committed impacts; adaptation without mitigation faces ever-escalating challenges. The model shows which impacts are avoidable through mitigation and which require adaptation regardless.
• Nature-Based Solutions: Ecosystems can provide climate benefits alongside human infrastructure: mangrove forests reduce storm surge energy by 66% per kilometer of forest width, urban tree canopy reduces air temperatures by 2-5 degrees C, restored wetlands absorb floodwater and sequester carbon, and sustainable agriculture practices increase soil carbon storage while improving crop resilience. Nature-based solutions are often more cost-effective and provide co-benefits (biodiversity, water quality, recreation) that engineered infrastructure does not.
• Equity-Centered Climate Planning: Climate planning must center equity because climate impacts disproportionately affect low-income communities, communities of color, and coastal populations. Effective equity-centered planning includes: mapping vulnerability (who is most exposed and least resourced), prioritizing investments in frontline communities, ensuring meaningful community participation in planning decisions, and designing financial mechanisms that don't burden the most vulnerable with adaptation costs.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan integrates mitigation and adaptation with evidence from model scenarios, includes nature-based and engineered solutions, addresses equity explicitly with vulnerability mapping, and provides monitoring metrics with adaptive management triggers
• Proficient (3): Plan includes both mitigation and adaptation strategies with reasoning connected to model feedback loops and equity considerations
• Developing (2): Plan covers basic climate response strategies but lacks integration between mitigation and adaptation, or does not address equity
• Beginning (1): Plan is incomplete or does not connect strategies to the coupled climate-ecosystem model's feedback loop dynamics

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a feedback loop diagram template with labeled positive (+) and negative (-) arrows, asking students to identify which loops are self-amplifying and which are self-correcting
  • Use a climate impact matrix: 'At 1.5 degrees C warming: Sea Level Rise = ___, Extreme Weather = ___, Crop Yield = ___. At 3.0 degrees C warming: Sea Level Rise = ___, Extreme Weather = ___, Crop Yield = ___.'
  • Scaffold adaptation planning: 'The unavoidable impacts for our city are ___. The most vulnerable populations are ___. The highest-priority adaptation investments are ___ because ___'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the IPCC's latest Assessment Report and compare its warming projections to your model's predictions — where does your simplified model agree with and differ from the full Earth system models?
  • Investigate the concept of 'carbon debt' — calculating the total historical CO2 emissions of each nation and comparing to current per-capita emissions — and design a climate finance framework based on historical responsibility
  • Model a specific tipping cascade: Arctic ice loss triggers albedo feedback, which accelerates permafrost thaw, which releases methane, which warms the tropics, which kills coral reefs, which collapses fisheries — trace the causal chain and identify intervention points

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the carbon budget remaining to keep warming below 1.5 degrees C (approximately 400 GtCO2 remaining at current rates) and determine how many years of current emissions (approximately 40 GtCO2/year) remain before the budget is exhausted
  • ELA: Write a policy brief for the city council arguing for an integrated climate adaptation plan, using model-derived evidence to demonstrate the cost of inaction versus the cost of preparation, and addressing climate justice principles
  • Social Studies/Ethics: Analyze the concept of 'loss and damage' in international climate negotiations — the argument that wealthy, high-emitting nations owe compensation to vulnerable, low-emitting nations for unavoidable climate impacts — and propose a fair mechanism for calculating and distributing climate reparations

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the coupled feedback loops between atmospheric CO2, global temperature, ocean absorption, permafrost methane release, and forest carbon sequestration — identifying positive and negative feedbacks
• Analyze tipping point dynamics by identifying the temperature thresholds beyond which positive feedback loops become self-sustaining regardless of emission reductions
• Evaluate the cascading consequences of climate change across ecological (species migration, forest die-off), agricultural (crop yield), coastal (sea level rise), and societal (adaptation capacity) systems

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Global Temperature increases by 3 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Based on your model, which of the following feedback loops is most likely to become self-sustaining at this temperature, causing continued warming regardless of emission reductions?
• Constructed Response: Using your coupled climate-ecosystem model, explain why reducing Atmospheric CO2 emissions to zero today would NOT immediately stop climate change. Reference at least four model components and describe the lag effects and committed changes already locked into the system.

  _________________________________________________________

• What monitoring and early warning systems would you install to detect when tipping points are being approached?
