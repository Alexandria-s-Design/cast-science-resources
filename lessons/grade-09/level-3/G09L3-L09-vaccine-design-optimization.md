### Title
**Vaccine Design Optimization — Modeling Immune Response Engineering from Antigen Selection to Population-Level Protection**

### Overview
This lesson introduces students to computational vaccine design — one of the most important applications of immunological modeling. Biotech skill focus: Multi-objective optimization against an evolving target. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both the power of rapid vaccine development and the challenges of designing durable protection against a mutating pathogen. Students investigate the driving question: COVID-19 vaccines were developed in under a year — a process that usually takes 10-15 years. How do computational models of the immune system make it possible to design vaccines faster, and can we design a universal vaccine that works against a virus that keeps mutating? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 3: Biotech

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS1-4, HS-LS4-2**: Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division in producing and maintaining complex organisms; construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors.

### Learning Objectives
- Build an immune response model that traces the cascade from antigen presentation through immune cell activation to antibody production, memory formation, and population-level protection
- Analyze how antigen selection, adjuvant strength, and pathogen mutation rate interact to determine vaccine effectiveness and duration of immunity
- Optimize vaccine design parameters to maximize population coverage while accounting for viral evolution and immune diversity
- Evaluate the trade-offs between vaccine specificity (targeting one strain precisely) and cross-reactivity (providing broader but weaker protection against multiple variants)

### Component List (Starting Model: 9 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Antigen Selection | External | The choice of which pathogen molecular target to include in the vaccine — ideally a surface protein that is essential for pathogen function (so it cannot easily mutate away), highly immunogenic (triggers strong immune responses), and conserved across variants (so immunity is broadly protective) |
| Adjuvant Strength | External | The potency of the immune-stimulating compound included in the vaccine formulation — stronger adjuvants produce more robust immune responses but also increase the risk of inflammation and side effects (reactogenicity) |
| Immune Cell Activation | Internal | The degree to which innate immune cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) process and present the vaccine antigen to adaptive immune cells (T cells, B cells) — the critical bridge between innate recognition and adaptive immunity |
| Antibody Production Rate | Internal | The speed and magnitude of antibody secretion by activated B cells (plasma cells) — determines how quickly protective antibody levels are reached after vaccination and the peak antibody titer achieved |
| Memory Cell Formation | Internal | The differentiation of activated B cells and T cells into long-lived memory cells that persist for years to decades — the key determinant of how long vaccine-induced immunity lasts |
| Pathogen Mutation Rate | External | The speed at which the target pathogen accumulates mutations in its surface proteins — RNA viruses mutate 100-1000x faster than DNA viruses, creating new variants that may escape vaccine-induced immunity |
| Cross-Reactivity | Internal | The degree to which antibodies generated against the vaccine antigen also recognize and neutralize variant strains of the pathogen — broader cross-reactivity provides protection against future variants but typically with lower potency per variant |
| Duration of Immunity | Internal | The length of time that vaccine-induced protection remains above the threshold needed to prevent infection or severe disease — determined by memory cell longevity, antibody half-life, and the rate of pathogen antigenic drift |
| Population Coverage | Internal | The fraction of a genetically diverse population that achieves protective immunity from the vaccine — influenced by human genetic variation in immune response genes (HLA diversity), age-related immune differences, and immunocompromised individuals |

VACCINE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION

Modeling Immune Response Engineering from Antigen Selection to Population-Level Protection.
COVID-19 vaccines were developed in under a year — a process that usually takes 10-15 years. How do computational models of the immune system make it possible to design vaccines faster, and can we design a universal vaccine that works against a virus that keeps mutating?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Antigen Selection" — the choice of which pathogen molecular target to include in the vaccine — ideally a surface protein that is essential for pathogen function (so it cannot easily mutate away)
  ○ Click "Adjuvant Strength" — the potency of the immune-stimulating compound included in the vaccine formulation — stronger adjuvants produce more robust immune responses but also increase the risk of inflammation and side effects (reactogenicity)
  ○ Click "Pathogen Mutation Rate" — the speed at which the target pathogen accumulates mutations in its surface proteins — rna viruses mutate 100-1000x faster than dna viruses
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Immune Cell Activation" — the degree to which innate immune cells (dendritic cells
  ○ Click "Antibody Production Rate" — the speed and magnitude of antibody secretion by activated b cells (plasma cells) — determines how quickly protective antibody levels are reached after vaccination and the peak antibody titer achieved
  ○ Click "Memory Cell Formation" — the differentiation of activated b cells and t cells into long-lived memory cells that persist for years to decades — the key determinant of how long vaccine-induced immunity lasts
  ○ Click "Cross-Reactivity" — the degree to which antibodies generated against the vaccine antigen also recognize and neutralize variant strains of the pathogen — broader cross-reactivity provides protection against future variants but typically with lower potency per variant
  ○ Click "Duration of Immunity" — the length of time that vaccine-induced protection remains above the threshold needed to prevent infection or severe disease — determined by memory cell longevity
  ○ Click "Population Coverage" — the fraction of a genetically diverse population that achieves protective immunity from the vaccine — influenced by human genetic variation in immune response genes (hla diversity)

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 9 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"COVID-19 vaccines were developed in under a year — a process that usually takes 10-15 years. How do computational models of the immune system make it possible to design vaccines faster, and can we design a universal vaccine that works against a virus that keeps mutating?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Antigen Selection' — that's external. The choice of which pathogen molecular target to include in the vaccine — ideally a surface protein that is essential for pathogen function (so it cannot easily mutate away).
Click on 'Adjuvant Strength' — that's external. The potency of the immune-stimulating compound included in the vaccine formulation — stronger adjuvants produce more robust immune responses but also increase the risk of inflammation and side effects (reactogenicity).
Click on 'Immune Cell Activation' — that's internal. The degree to which innate immune cells (dendritic cells.
Click on 'Antibody Production Rate' — that's internal. The speed and magnitude of antibody secretion by activated B cells (plasma cells) — determines how quickly protective antibody levels are reached after vaccination and the peak antibody titer achieved.
Click on 'Memory Cell Formation' — that's internal. The differentiation of activated B cells and T cells into long-lived memory cells that persist for years to decades — the key determinant of how long vaccine-induced immunity lasts.
Click on 'Pathogen Mutation Rate' — that's external. The speed at which the target pathogen accumulates mutations in its surface proteins — RNA viruses mutate 100-1000x faster than DNA viruses.
Click on 'Cross-Reactivity' — that's internal. The degree to which antibodies generated against the vaccine antigen also recognize and neutralize variant strains of the pathogen — broader cross-reactivity provides protection against future variants but typically with lower potency per variant.
Click on 'Duration of Immunity' — that's internal. The length of time that vaccine-induced protection remains above the threshold needed to prevent infection or severe disease — determined by memory cell longevity.
Click on 'Population Coverage' — that's internal. The fraction of a genetically diverse population that achieves protective immunity from the vaccine — influenced by human genetic variation in immune response genes (HLA diversity).

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Antigen Selection, Adjuvant Strength, and Pathogen Mutation Rate are the three external components. Antigen Selection and Adjuvant Strength are design decisions made by the vaccinologist — which piece of the pathogen to include and how strongly to stimulate the immune response. Pathogen Mutation Rate is an external biological reality determined by the virus's replication fidelity and population dynamics — it is not under the vaccine designer's control but profoundly affects vaccine performance. All other six components are internal: Immune Cell Activation, Antibody Production Rate, Memory Cell Formation, Cross-Reactivity, Duration of Immunity, and Population Coverage emerge as biological responses to the vaccine design interacting with human immune physiology and pathogen evolution.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 9 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Antigen Selection" and drag an arrow to "Immune Cell Activation"
• Click on "Adjuvant Strength" and drag an arrow to "Immune Cell Activation"
• Click on "Immune Cell Activation" and drag an arrow to "Antibody Production Rate"
• Click on "Memory Cell Formation" and drag an arrow to "Duration of Immunity"
• Click on "Pathogen Mutation Rate" and drag an arrow to "Duration of Immunity"
• Click on "Cross-Reactivity" and drag an arrow to "Population Coverage"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Antigen Selection → Immune Cell Activation = POSITIVE (+)
    More immunogenic antigens (those that are well-recognized by human immune system components) produce stronger dendritic cell activation and more effective antigen presentation to T cells, amplifying the downstream adaptive response.

  ○ Adjuvant Strength → Immune Cell Activation = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger adjuvants activate more innate immune cells and induce higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines, amplifying antigen presentation and lowering the activation threshold for adaptive immune cells.

  ○ Immune Cell Activation → Antibody Production Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Greater immune cell activation produces more activated helper T cells, which provide stronger signals for B cell clonal expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

  ○ Memory Cell Formation → Duration of Immunity = POSITIVE (+)
    More robust memory cell differentiation creates larger and more diverse pools of long-lived memory B cells and T cells, enabling faster and stronger recall responses for longer periods after vaccination.

  ○ Pathogen Mutation Rate → Duration of Immunity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Faster pathogen mutation generates variants that escape vaccine-induced immune recognition more quickly, eroding the effective Duration of Immunity even when memory cells remain functional — because the virus changes, not the memory.

  ○ Cross-Reactivity → Population Coverage = POSITIVE (+)
    Broader cross-reactivity means the vaccine provides at least partial protection against more pathogen variants, increasing the fraction of the population that encounters a variant covered by their vaccine-induced immunity.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 6 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 5 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: Vaccine design is a multi-dimensional optimization problem with no perfect solution. You want high Antibody Production Rate, but if Adjuvant Strength is too high, the side effects become unacceptable and people refuse the vaccine. You want strong Memory Cell Formation for long Duration of Immunity, but Pathogen Mutation Rate can outrun even robust memory responses — look at influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year. You want maximum Cross-Reactivity to cover all variants, but broader Cross-Reactivity usually means weaker response to any specific variant. And Population Coverage varies because of human genetic diversity in immune system genes (HLA types). How do you design a vaccine that balances all of these competing constraints — especially against a pathogen that is actively evolving to escape your vaccine?

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Antigen Selection' and drag an arrow
over to 'Immune Cell Activation.'

Here's the key question: When antigen selection goes UP, does
immune cell activation go UP or DOWN?

More immunogenic antigens (those that are well-recognized by human immune system components) produce stronger dendritic cell activation and more effective antigen presentation to T cells, amplifying the downstream adaptive response.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Adjuvant Strength' and drag an arrow
over to 'Immune Cell Activation.'

Here's the key question: When adjuvant strength goes UP, does
immune cell activation go UP or DOWN?

Stronger adjuvants activate more innate immune cells and induce higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines, amplifying antigen presentation and lowering the activation threshold for adaptive immune cells.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Immune Cell Activation' and drag an arrow
over to 'Antibody Production Rate.'

Here's the key question: When immune cell activation goes UP, does
antibody production rate go UP or DOWN?

Greater immune cell activation produces more activated helper T cells, which provide stronger signals for B cell clonal expansion and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Memory Cell Formation' and drag an arrow
over to 'Duration of Immunity.'

Here's the key question: When memory cell formation goes UP, does
duration of immunity go UP or DOWN?

More robust memory cell differentiation creates larger and more diverse pools of long-lived memory B cells and T cells, enabling faster and stronger recall responses for longer periods after vaccination.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Pathogen Mutation Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Duration of Immunity.'

Here's the key question: When pathogen mutation rate goes UP, does
duration of immunity go UP or DOWN?

Faster pathogen mutation generates variants that escape vaccine-induced immune recognition more quickly, eroding the effective Duration of Immunity even when memory cells remain functional — because the virus changes, not the memory.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Cross-Reactivity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Population Coverage.'

Here's the key question: When cross-reactivity goes UP, does
population coverage go UP or DOWN?

Broader cross-reactivity means the vaccine provides at least partial protection against more pathogen variants, increasing the fraction of the population that encounters a variant covered by their vaccine-induced immunity.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 5
positive relationships. 6 arrows total.

Vaccine design is a multi-dimensional optimization problem with no perfect solution. You want high Antibody Production Rate, but if Adjuvant Strength is too high, the side effects become unacceptable and people refuse the vaccine. You want strong Memory Cell Formation for long Duration of Immunity, but Pathogen Mutation Rate can outrun even robust memory responses — look at influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year.

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Antigen Selection is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — STRAIN-SPECIFIC
• Dominant strain antigen, moderate adjuvant
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to vaccine effectiveness when a new variant emerges with mutations in the target antigen?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — BROADLY PROTECTIVE
• Conserved region antigen, strong adjuvant
• PREDICT FIRST: Do you predict that targeting a conserved region provides better long-term protection despite lower peak antibody levels?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — HIGH-MUTATION CHALLENGE
• Fast-mutating pathogen, any vaccine design
• PREDICT FIRST: How quickly do you predict the pathogen will evolve to escape vaccine-induced immunity at maximum Pathogen Mutation Rate?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• There is a fundamental trade-off between vaccine specificity and breadth — vaccines targeting strain-specific epitopes generate stronger antibody responses but are vulnerable to antigenic drift, while vaccines targeting conserved regions are more durable but less potent
• Adjuvant strength has diminishing returns — moderate adjuvant produces significantly better immune responses than no adjuvant, but very strong adjuvant increases side effects faster than it increases protection, reducing real-world uptake and Population Coverage
• Memory Cell Formation is the most critical component for long-term protection — even when circulating antibodies wane, robust immunological memory enables rapid recall responses that prevent severe disease upon re-exposure
• Population Coverage is limited by human genetic diversity — HLA (human leukocyte antigen) variation means the same vaccine antigen is presented differently to immune cells in different people, making universal vaccine design for genetically diverse populations inherently challenging

THE ANSWER: Vaccine design is fundamentally an optimization problem with competing constraints. The nine components of this model capture the core trade-offs: Antigen Selection determines what the immune system learns to recognize — too specific and variants escape, too conserved and the response is weak. Adjuvant Strength amplifies the immune response but with side-effect trade-offs. Immune Cell Activation bridges innate and adaptive immunity. Antibody Production Rate and Memory Cell Formation determine short-term and long-term protection respectively. Pathogen Mutation Rate is the adversary — constantly generating variants that test the breadth of vaccine-induced immunity. Cross-Reactivity is the defense against mutation, but it comes at the cost of per-variant potency. Duration of Immunity depends on the race between memory persistence and antigenic drift. And Population Coverage reflects the reality that human immune systems are genetically diverse, meaning no single vaccine design is optimal for every individual. Computational modeling allows vaccinologists to simulate thousands of antigen-adjuvant combinations against evolving pathogen populations in diverse human genetics — identifying the design sweet spot before committing to expensive clinical trials.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Strain-Specific. Dominant strain antigen, moderate adjuvant.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Broadly Protective.
Conserved region antigen, strong adjuvant.

Before you run it — make a prediction. Do you predict that targeting a conserved region provides better long-term protection despite lower peak antibody levels?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: High-Mutation Challenge. Fast-mutating pathogen, any vaccine design.
How quickly do you predict the pathogen will evolve to escape vaccine-induced immunity at maximum Pathogen Mutation Rate?

Here's what our model reveals: Vaccine design is fundamentally an optimization problem with competing constraints. The nine components of this model capture the core trade-offs: Antigen Selection determines what the immune system learns to recognize — too specific and variants escape, too conserved and the response is weak. Adjuvant Strength amplifies the immune response but with side-effect trade-offs. Immune Cell Activation bridges innate and adaptive immunity.

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Antigen Selection?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Adjuvant Strength?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Pathogen Mutation Rate?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • T Cell Response Quality — The robustness of the cytotoxic T cell (killer T cell) response to the vaccine — while antibodies prevent infection, T cells destroy already-infected cells, providing a critical second line of defense that is often more durable and cross-reactive than antibody responses
   • Delivery Platform Efficiency — The technology used to present the antigen to the immune system — mRNA (rapid design, strong response, cold storage required), protein subunit (stable, well-understood, weaker response), viral vector (strong response, anti-vector immunity limits boosting), and nanoparticle (multivalent display, complex manufacturing)
   • Immune Imprinting Effect — The tendency of the immune system to preferentially recall its first response to a pathogen family rather than mounting a de novo response to new variants — original antigenic sin can reduce the effectiveness of updated vaccines by biasing the immune response toward the original strain

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • How Vaccines Work: The Immune Response Cascade — how does this connect to your model?
   • Antigen Selection: The Foundation of Vaccine Design — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:

   • Why is Pathogen Mutation Rate the most challenging component for long-term vaccine design — and how does Antigen Selection strategy affect vulnerability to antigenic drift?
   • What did the model reveal about the relationship between Adjuvant Strength and real-world Population Coverage — why doesn't 'stronger adjuvant' always mean 'better vaccine'?
   • How would adding Immune Imprinting Effect change your model's predictions about booster vaccine effectiveness?

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 9 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

T Cell Response Quality. The robustness of the cytotoxic T cell (killer T cell) response to the vaccine — while antibodies prevent infection, T cells destroy already-infected cells, providing a critical second line of defense that is often more durable and cross-reactive than antibody responses
How would you model that?

Delivery Platform Efficiency.

Immune Imprinting Effect. The tendency of the immune system to preferentially recall its first response to a pathogen family rather than mounting a de novo response to new variants — original antigenic sin can reduce the effectiveness of updated vaccines by biasing the immune response toward the original strain

## TPT Materials

### PowerPoint Slides

```
SLIDE 1: COVER
Visual: Title slide with dramatic imagery of vaccine vials, viral particles, and antibody structures
Say: "COVID-19 vaccines went from genetic sequence to emergency authorization in 11 months. The previous record was 4 years. How did computational modeling make this possible — and can we design vaccines that never need updating?"
Do: Display the timeline comparison: traditional vaccine development (10-15 years) versus COVID-19 (11 months). Ask: What changed? What role did modeling play?
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 2: LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Visual: Learning goals with immunology vocabulary
Say: "Today you're vaccine designers. You'll learn why vaccine design is one of the hardest optimization problems in biology — because your target is literally evolving to escape you."
Do: Pre-teach antigen and adjuvant. Use the analogy: an antigen is a 'wanted poster' that teaches your immune system what to look for; an adjuvant is the megaphone that makes sure the immune system pays attention.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 3: BIG QUESTION
Visual: Can we design a universal vaccine that outruns viral evolution?
Say: "You need a new flu vaccine every year because the virus mutates its surface proteins. But you only need one measles vaccine for life. What's different about measles? Can we make flu behave more like measles?"
Do: Think-pair-share: Why do some vaccines last a lifetime while others need annual updating? What properties of the virus and the vaccine determine durability? Collect hypotheses.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 4: LEVER FRAMEWORK
Visual: LEVER steps with immunology and evolutionary biology context
Say: "We're modeling the full cascade: from what you put in the vaccine to how the immune system responds to whether protection lasts when the virus mutates. And the virus IS mutating — that's the adversary in this model."
Do: Preview LEVER steps. Emphasize the unique challenge: this model has an adversarial component (Pathogen Mutation Rate) that actively works against the vaccine design.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS
Visual: Nine component cards spanning vaccine design, immune response, and protection outcome levels
Say: "Three of these nine components are inputs. Two you control (Antigen Selection, Adjuvant Strength). One you DON'T control (Pathogen Mutation Rate) — and it's working against you. Sort them."
Do: Guide sorting of external versus internal components. Emphasize the adversarial nature of Pathogen Mutation Rate as an uncontrollable external input that actively undermines vaccine effectiveness.
Time: 8 min

TEACHER GUIDE: Vaccine Design Optimization
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson introduces students to computational vaccine design — one of the most important applications of immunological modeling. Biotech skill focus: Multi-objective optimization against an evolving target. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both the power of rapid vaccine development and the challenges of designing durable protection against a mutating pathogen.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS1-4, HS-LS4-2: Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division in producing and maintaining complex organisms; construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models / Constructing Explanations
  Students develop an immune response model that connects molecular antigen-antibody interactions to cellular immune activation to population-level epidemiological outcomes, constructing explanations for vaccine design trade-offs.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function / LS4.C Adaptation
  Immune system cells have specialized structures that enable antigen recognition, antibody production, and immunological memory; pathogen adaptation through mutation creates an evolutionary arms race that constrains vaccine design.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect / Structure and Function
  Students trace causal chains from antigen molecular structure through immune cell recognition to antibody specificity and population-level protection, analyzing how pathogen structural evolution disrupts vaccine-induced immunity.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Antigen, Adjuvant, Immunological Memory, Antigenic Drift
□ Prepare COVID-19 vaccines were developed in under a year — a process that usually takes 10-15 years. How do computational models of the immune system make it possible to design vaccines faster, and can we design a universal vaccine that works against a virus that keeps mutating discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify nine components spanning vaccine design inputs (Antigen Selection, Adjuvant Strength, Pathogen Mutation Rate), immune response dynamics (Immune Cell Activation, Antibody Production Rate, Memory Cell Formation), and protection outcomes (Cross-Reactivity, Duration of Immunity, Population Coverage).
• Establish: Students determine that Antigen Selection, Adjuvant Strength, and Pathogen Mutation Rate are external inputs — two under the vaccinologist's control and one representing the evolutionary adversary — while Immune Cell Activation, Antibody Production Rate, Memory Cell Formation, Cross-Reactivity, Duration of Immunity, and Population Coverage emerge as biological responses.
• Visualize: Students build an immune response model connecting vaccine inputs through immune cell activation and antibody production to protection outcomes, visualizing the trade-offs between specificity and breadth, potency and safety, and short-term and long-term protection.
• Evaluate: Students run strain-specific, broadly-protective, and high-mutation-challenge scenarios to discover how antigen selection strategy determines vulnerability to pathogen evolution.
• Revise: Students add T Cell Response Quality, Delivery Platform Efficiency, or Immune Imprinting Effect to explore additional dimensions of vaccine design optimization.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• How Vaccines Work: The Immune Response Cascade:
  Vaccines exploit the adaptive immune system's ability to learn and remember. When a vaccine antigen is injected, innate immune cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) engulf and process it, presenting peptide fragments on their surface via MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules. Helper T cells recognize these presented peptides and activate, releasing cytokines that drive B cell activation. Activated B cells with receptors that match the antigen undergo clonal expansion (rapid division) and affinity maturation (mutation and selection for tighter antigen binding). Some activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete large quantities of antibodies; others become long-lived memory B cells. Simultaneously, cytotoxic T cells are activated to kill cells displaying the target peptides. The entire process takes 1-2 weeks for a primary response but only 1-3 days for a secondary (memory) response — which is why vaccines work: the memory response is fast enough to clear the pathogen before it causes disease.

• Antigen Selection: The Foundation of Vaccine Design:
  The choice of antigen determines everything else about a vaccine. An ideal antigen is: immunodominant (strongly recognized by diverse immune systems), essential for pathogen function (the pathogen cannot easily mutate it without losing fitness), surface-exposed (accessible to antibodies), and conserved across variants (mutations in this region are rare). In practice, these criteria often conflict. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is highly immunodominant and surface-exposed but also rapidly mutating because it is under intense immune selection pressure. The spike protein's fusion machinery (S2 subunit) is more conserved but less immunodominant. The internal nucleoprotein is highly conserved but not accessible to antibodies (though T cells can target it). Computational modeling allows vaccinologists to evaluate thousands of potential antigen designs against simulated pathogen evolution, identifying targets that balance immunogenicity with conservation.

• Adjuvants and Immune Amplification:
  Purified protein antigens alone often produce weak immune responses — the adaptive immune system needs 'danger signals' from the innate immune system to mount a full response. Adjuvants provide these danger signals. Aluminum salts (alum) — the oldest and most common adjuvant — create a depot effect that prolongs antigen exposure and activate inflammasome pathways. AS01B (used in the Shingrix shingles vaccine) combines a toll-like receptor agonist with a saponin to produce exceptionally strong immune responses. MF59 (an oil-in-water emulsion) enhances antigen uptake by dendritic cells. mRNA vaccines use the lipid nanoparticle delivery system as a built-in adjuvant because the mRNA itself activates innate immune sensors. The choice of adjuvant determines the magnitude, quality, and durability of the immune response — but stronger adjuvants also produce more local and systemic reactogenicity (injection site pain, fever, fatigue), which affects public acceptance and population-level uptake.

• The Evolutionary Arms Race: Pathogen Mutation and Immune Escape:
  Vaccination creates a selection pressure on the pathogen: viral variants that can evade vaccine-induced immunity have a fitness advantage and become dominant. This is antigenic drift — the gradual accumulation of mutations in immune-targeted surface proteins. Influenza A virus mutates its hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein at a rate of approximately 4-6 amino acid substitutions per year, sufficient to require annual vaccine reformulation. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated even faster antigenic evolution, with new variants of concern emerging every few months during the pandemic. The fundamental challenge for vaccine design is that the pathogen is not a static target — it is an evolving adversary that actively adapts to escape immune pressure. Computational models that co-simulate vaccine-induced immune responses AND pathogen evolution are essential for designing vaccines that maintain effectiveness over time.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Vaccines give you a weakened version of the disease"
  Reality: While some historical vaccines used weakened (attenuated) live virus, most modern vaccines do NOT contain any live pathogen. Subunit vaccines contain only purified proteins. mRNA vaccines contain instructions for the body to make one viral protein (not the whole virus). Inactivated vaccines contain killed virus that cannot replicate. None of these can cause the disease they protect against. The immune system responds to the molecular shape of the antigen, not to the disease process itself.
  Strategy: Categorize: List 5 vaccines and their type (live attenuated, inactivated, subunit, mRNA, viral vector). Which ones contain live virus? Which cannot possibly cause infection? How does the immune response compare?

• "If a vaccine doesn't prevent infection 100%, it doesn't work"
  Reality: Vaccines provide a SPECTRUM of protection, not a binary shield. Even when a vaccine doesn't prevent infection entirely, it typically: reduces symptom severity by 70-90%, reduces hospitalization by 80-95%, reduces death by 90-99%, and reduces transmission by 40-60%. The model's Population Coverage component shows that even partially effective vaccines dramatically reduce disease burden at the population level through herd immunity effects and reduced transmission.
  Strategy: Calculate: If a vaccine is 70% effective at preventing infection and 95% effective at preventing hospitalization, what happens to hospital overcrowding during a pandemic if 80% of the population is vaccinated versus 20%?

• "Natural immunity is always better than vaccine immunity"
  Reality: Natural infection sometimes produces stronger immunity than vaccination — but at the cost of suffering the actual disease, with its risks of hospitalization, long-term complications, and death. The model shows that vaccines can be designed to optimize specific aspects of immunity (like Memory Cell Formation and Cross-Reactivity) that natural infection may not optimally stimulate. Adjuvants and delivery platforms can direct the immune response toward the most protective pathways. Furthermore, vaccines can target conserved epitopes that natural infection may not prominently expose to the immune system.
  Strategy: Thought experiment: If natural COVID infection gives stronger antibodies but also has a 1% chance of killing you, and the vaccine gives somewhat weaker antibodies with a 0.001% chance of serious side effects — which is the better population-level strategy? At what risk level would natural immunity become preferable?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: COVID-19 vaccines were developed in under a year — a process that usually takes 10-15 years. How do computational models of the immune system make it possible to design vaccines faster, and can we design a universal vaccine that works against a virus that keeps mutating?
Answer: Vaccine design is fundamentally an optimization problem with competing constraints. The nine components of this model capture the core trade-offs: Antigen Selection determines what the immune system learns to recognize — too specific and variants escape, too conserved and the response is weak. Adjuvant Strength amplifies the immune response but with side-effect trade-offs. Immune Cell Activation bridges innate and adaptive immunity. Antibody Production Rate and Memory Cell Formation determine short-term and long-term protection respectively. Pathogen Mutation Rate is the adversary — constantly generating variants that test the breadth of vaccine-induced immunity. Cross-Reactivity is the defense against mutation, but it comes at the cost of per-variant potency. Duration of Immunity depends on the race between memory persistence and antigenic drift. And Population Coverage reflects the reality that human immune systems are genetically diverse, meaning no single vaccine design is optimal for every individual. Computational modeling allows vaccinologists to simulate thousands of antigen-adjuvant combinations against evolving pathogen populations in diverse human genetics — identifying the design sweet spot before committing to expensive clinical trials.

Simulation Answers:
• Strain-Specific Vaccine Scenario: With a highly specific antigen targeting the dominant circulating strain, Immune Cell Activation and Antibody Production Rate are high — the immune system generates a strong, focused response. Cross-Reactivity is low because the antibodies precisely fit only the target strain's epitopes. Initially, this vaccine provides excellent protection with high efficacy. However, when Pathogen Mutation Rate generates new variants with changes in the targeted epitope, Duration of Immunity drops sharply. The vaccine becomes ineffective against the new variant within 6-18 months, requiring reformulation — exactly the problem with current seasonal flu vaccines.
• High-Mutation Pathogen Challenge Scenario: At maximum Pathogen Mutation Rate, the adversarial nature of viral evolution is starkly visible. Regardless of initial vaccine design, the pathogen generates escape variants on a timeline of months. Strain-specific vaccines lose efficacy first. Broadly protective vaccines maintain partial protection longer due to Cross-Reactivity, but even conserved regions accumulate some variation over time. The model demonstrates that no single vaccination event can provide permanent protection against a rapidly-evolving pathogen — ongoing surveillance, updated formulations, or universal vaccine approaches targeting highly conserved essential structures are necessary.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: What is the specificity-breadth trade-off in vaccine design?
  A: The model reveals a fundamental immunological trade-off: antibodies that bind one specific epitope with very high affinity (high specificity) typically cannot bind variant epitopes with different shapes (low cross-reactivity). Conversely, antibodies that recognize a broader range of variant structures (high cross-reactivity) typically bind each individual variant with lower affinity (lower per-variant potency). This is because antibody binding sites are shaped to be complementary to their target — the more precisely they fit one target, the less they fit related but different targets. Vaccine Antigen Selection determines where on this spectrum the immune response falls: strain-specific antigens drive high-affinity, narrow responses; conserved-region antigens drive lower-affinity, broader responses.
• Q: Why does Pathogen Mutation Rate erode immunity even when Memory Cell Formation is strong?
  A: Memory cells remember the SPECIFIC antigen they were trained on. When the pathogen mutates its surface proteins, the memory cells still remember the old version perfectly — but the new version looks different enough that memory cell recognition is weakened or lost entirely. This is not a failure of immunological memory; it's a success of pathogen evolution. The model shows that Duration of Immunity depends not just on how well the immune system remembers, but on whether the pathogen remains recognizable to what the immune system remembers. This is why targeting highly conserved, functionally essential regions is the key strategy for durable protection — the pathogen cannot mutate these regions without losing fitness.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Universal Influenza Vaccine Strategy
Mission: Design a vaccine strategy that provides broad, long-lasting protection against influenza — eliminating the need for annual reformulation by targeting conserved viral elements.
Scenario: The WHO has launched a $1 billion initiative to develop a universal influenza vaccine — one that works against all flu strains and doesn't need to be redesigned every year. Current seasonal flu vaccines are only 20-60% effective because they target rapidly-mutating surface proteins (hemagglutinin head). Your immunology team must design a vaccine strategy that targets conserved viral elements to provide durable, broadly protective immunity.
Introduction: Present the challenge: The WHO has launched a $1 billion initiative to develop a universal influenza vaccine that eliminates the need for annual reformulation. Current flu vaccines are only 20-60% effective because they target rapidly-mutating surface proteins. Your immunology team will design a vaccine strategy targeting conserved viral elements for durable, broadly protective immunity.

Key Concepts:
• Conserved Antigen Targeting: Influenza has several conserved protein regions that cannot easily mutate without losing viral fitness: the hemagglutinin stalk domain (required for membrane fusion), the M2 ion channel ectodomain (required for viral uncoating), and internal proteins like nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M1) that are essential for replication. Each has different advantages: HA stalk antibodies can neutralize the virus directly; M2e antibodies recruit immune cells to kill infected cells; NP-specific T cells provide cross-reactive cellular immunity. A multi-antigen approach may be necessary.
• mRNA Platform Advantages: mRNA vaccine technology offers unique advantages for universal vaccine design: rapid sequence modification (weeks versus months for protein vaccines), ability to encode multiple antigens in one formulation, strong activation of both antibody and T cell responses, and self-adjuvanting properties of the lipid nanoparticle delivery system. mRNA vaccines can be quickly updated when new conserved antigen designs are identified through computational modeling.
• Clinical Trial Design for Broadly Protective Vaccines: Proving that a universal vaccine works is uniquely challenging because you need to demonstrate protection against strains that haven't emerged yet. Strategies include: testing against historically diverse archived strains in laboratory neutralization assays, animal challenge studies with multiple divergent strains, human challenge studies with controlled infection, and computational modeling of predicted protection against simulated future variants based on known evolutionary trajectories.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Strategy includes justified conserved antigen selection with evolutionary analysis, platform rationale, multi-antigen design consideration, clinical trial plan for broad protection, and population coverage analysis supported by model predictions
• Proficient (3): Strategy includes antigen selection targeting conserved regions with reasoning connected to model trade-offs and basic clinical validation approach
• Developing (2): Strategy identifies conserved targets but lacks detail on platform selection, breadth validation, or population coverage considerations
• Beginning (1): Strategy is incomplete or does not connect antigen selection to the immune response model's specificity-breadth trade-off

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a visual diagram of the immune response cascade from vaccine injection through antigen presentation, T cell and B cell activation, to antibody production and memory formation
  • Use an antigen comparison table: 'Antigen: ___, Conservation level: ___/10, Immunogenicity: ___/10, Surface accessible: Y/N, Cross-reactivity prediction: ___'
  • Scaffold the evolutionary trade-off: 'If I target the most immunogenic epitope, it will mutate in ___ months. If I target the most conserved epitope, my antibody levels will be ___% lower. The optimal strategy is ___'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the history of universal influenza vaccine attempts — what strategies have been tried, what failed, and what current candidates show the most promise?
  • Investigate how computational protein design (like RosettaDesign) is being used to create 'designer antigens' — artificial protein structures that present conserved epitopes in highly immunogenic conformations
  • Compare the immune evasion strategies of influenza (antigenic drift/shift), HIV (extreme variability, latency), and measles (antigenic stability) — what determines whether a virus can escape vaccine-induced immunity?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the probability that a virus with mutation rate M will generate an escape variant within T months, given N circulating viruses — model this as a Poisson process and determine the expected time to vaccine failure
  • ELA: Write a public health communication explaining why a universal flu vaccine would be one of the most important medical advances of the century — using data from your model to quantify the impact on global health
  • Social Studies/Ethics: Analyze the ethical frameworks for vaccine distribution during a pandemic — utilitarian (maximize lives saved), egalitarian (equal access), prioritarian (prioritize the vulnerable) — and how Population Coverage optimization relates to each framework

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the immune response cascade from vaccine antigen presentation through immune cell activation to antibody production, memory formation, and duration of protection
• Analyze the specificity-breadth trade-off in antigen selection and its implications for protection against evolving pathogens
• Evaluate vaccine design strategies for maximizing population coverage across genetically diverse human populations facing rapidly-mutating pathogens

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A new SARS-CoV-2 variant emerges with 15 mutations in the spike protein receptor-binding domain. Based on your model, which vaccine design strategy would maintain the most protection against this variant?
• Constructed Response: Using your immune response model, explain why a vaccine that produces very high antibody levels against one influenza strain might fail to protect against a new strain that emerges 6 months later. Reference at least three model components including Pathogen Mutation Rate, Cross-Reactivity, and Antigen Selection in your answer.
