### Title
**Engineering a Superbug Killer — Optimizing Bacteriophage Therapy Against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria**

### Overview
This lesson introduces students to predictive modeling and optimization in the context of bacteriophage therapy — one of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics. Biotech skill focus: Predictive modeling and optimization. With antibiotic resistance killing over 1.27 million people annually and the pipeline for new antibiotics nearly dry, phage therapy represents a paradigm shift in infectious disease treatment that students must understand. Students investigate the driving question: Antibiotics are failing. Can we engineer viruses to kill the superbugs that antibiotics can't? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 3: Biotech

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS1-2, HS-LS4-2**: Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms; construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from natural selection.

### Learning Objectives
- Build an optimization model for bacteriophage therapy that balances phage specificity, bacterial resistance evolution, and microbiome safety
- Analyze how phage-bacteria population dynamics interact with the human immune system across treatment timelines
- Optimize treatment timing and dosage to maximize bacterial kill while minimizing disruption to beneficial gut flora
- Evaluate how natural selection drives bacterial resistance to phage therapy and design strategies to counter it

### Component List (Starting Model: 9 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Phage Population | Internal | The total number of active bacteriophage particles in the patient's system, which increases through successful replication inside bacterial hosts and decreases through immune clearance and natural degradation |
| Target Bacteria Population | Internal | The count of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing the infection, which decreases as phages successfully infect and lyse cells but increases through bacterial reproduction |
| Phage Specificity | External | The engineered precision of the phage's targeting system — how well it distinguishes the pathogenic bacteria from beneficial microbiome species, adjustable through bioengineering of tail fiber proteins |
| Bacterial Resistance Rate | Internal | The speed at which the target bacterial population evolves resistance to the phage through mutations in surface receptor proteins, preventing phage attachment and infection |
| Immune System Response | Internal | The patient's innate and adaptive immune activity against both the infecting bacteria AND the therapeutic phages — the immune system may clear phages before they complete their work |
| Phage Replication Rate | Internal | The number of new phage particles produced per lysis event (burst size) multiplied by the infection frequency — determines how fast the phage population amplifies in the presence of target bacteria |
| Healthy Microbiome Impact | Internal | The degree of collateral damage to beneficial gut bacteria caused by off-target phage activity — lower Phage Specificity increases microbiome disruption |
| Treatment Timing | External | When in the infection timeline the phage therapy is initiated — early intervention targets smaller, less diverse bacterial populations while late intervention faces larger, potentially more resistant populations |
| Dosage Optimization | External | The calculated initial phage dose administered to the patient, which must be sufficient to establish a self-amplifying phage population before the immune system clears the therapeutic phages |

ENGINEERING A SUPERBUG KILLER

Optimizing Bacteriophage Therapy Against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.
Antibiotics are failing. Can we engineer viruses to kill the superbugs that antibiotics can't?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Phage Specificity" — the engineered precision of the phage's targeting system — how well it distinguishes the pathogenic bacteria from beneficial microbiome species
  ○ Click "Treatment Timing" — when in the infection timeline the phage therapy is initiated — early intervention targets smaller
  ○ Click "Dosage Optimization" — the calculated initial phage dose administered to the patient
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Phage Population" — the total number of active bacteriophage particles in the patient's system
  ○ Click "Target Bacteria Population" — the count of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing the infection
  ○ Click "Bacterial Resistance Rate" — the speed at which the target bacterial population evolves resistance to the phage through mutations in surface receptor proteins
  ○ Click "Immune System Response" — the patient's innate and adaptive immune activity against both the infecting bacteria and the therapeutic phages — the immune system may clear phages before they complete their work
  ○ Click "Phage Replication Rate" — the number of new phage particles produced per lysis event (burst size) multiplied by the infection frequency — determines how fast the phage population amplifies in the presence of target bacteria
  ○ Click "Healthy Microbiome Impact" — the degree of collateral damage to beneficial gut bacteria caused by off-target phage activity — lower phage specificity increases microbiome disruption

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 9 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"Antibiotics are failing. Can we engineer viruses to kill the superbugs that antibiotics can't?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Phage Population' — that's internal. The total number of active bacteriophage particles in the patient's system.
Click on 'Target Bacteria Population' — that's internal. The count of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing the infection.
Click on 'Phage Specificity' — that's external. The engineered precision of the phage's targeting system — how well it distinguishes the pathogenic bacteria from beneficial microbiome species.
Click on 'Bacterial Resistance Rate' — that's internal. The speed at which the target bacterial population evolves resistance to the phage through mutations in surface receptor proteins.
Click on 'Immune System Response' — that's internal. The patient's innate and adaptive immune activity against both the infecting bacteria AND the therapeutic phages — the immune system may clear phages before they complete their work.
Click on 'Phage Replication Rate' — that's internal. The number of new phage particles produced per lysis event (burst size) multiplied by the infection frequency — determines how fast the phage population amplifies in the presence of target bacteria.
Click on 'Healthy Microbiome Impact' — that's internal. The degree of collateral damage to beneficial gut bacteria caused by off-target phage activity — lower Phage Specificity increases microbiome disruption.
Click on 'Treatment Timing' — that's external. When in the infection timeline the phage therapy is initiated — early intervention targets smaller.
Click on 'Dosage Optimization' — that's external. The calculated initial phage dose administered to the patient.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Phage Specificity, Treatment Timing, and Dosage Optimization are external components because they represent parameters that clinicians and bioengineers directly control. Phage Specificity can be engineered through synthetic biology; Treatment Timing is a clinical decision; Dosage Optimization determines how many phages are initially administered. All other components — Phage Population, Target Bacteria Population, Bacterial Resistance Rate, Immune System Response, Phage Replication Rate, and Healthy Microbiome Impact — are internal biological responses that emerge from the dynamic interactions between phages, bacteria, and the patient's body.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 9 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Dosage Optimization" and drag an arrow to "Phage Population"
• Click on "Phage Population" and drag an arrow to "Target Bacteria Population"
• Click on "Target Bacteria Population" and drag an arrow to "Phage Replication Rate"
• Click on "Phage Specificity" and drag an arrow to "Healthy Microbiome Impact"
• Click on "Target Bacteria Population" and drag an arrow to "Bacterial Resistance Rate"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Dosage Optimization → Phage Population = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher initial phage dose establishes a larger starting Phage Population, increasing the probability that phages encounter and infect target bacteria before the immune system clears them.

  ○ Phage Population → Target Bacteria Population = NEGATIVE (−)
    More phages infecting and lysing target bacteria directly reduces the Target Bacteria Population through predator-prey dynamics.

  ○ Target Bacteria Population → Phage Replication Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More abundant target bacteria provide more hosts for phage replication, increasing Phage Replication Rate — this is the self-amplifying nature of phage therapy.

  ○ Phage Specificity → Healthy Microbiome Impact = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher Phage Specificity means the phages more precisely target only the pathogenic bacteria, reducing off-target damage to beneficial gut microbiome species.

  ○ Target Bacteria Population → Bacterial Resistance Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Larger bacterial populations contain more genetic diversity through random mutation, increasing the probability that resistance-conferring mutations exist and are selected for under phage pressure.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 5 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: Phage therapy has a remarkable feature: the treatment amplifies itself. Unlike antibiotics that degrade after administration, phages replicate inside the very bacteria they're killing. But the bacteria are evolving resistance in real time, and the patient's immune system may clear the phages. How do you optimize Dosage, Timing, and Specificity to win this three-way race?
```

"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Dosage Optimization' and drag an arrow
over to 'Phage Population.'

Here's the key question: When dosage optimization goes UP, does
phage population go UP or DOWN?

Higher initial phage dose establishes a larger starting Phage Population, increasing the probability that phages encounter and infect target bacteria before the immune system clears them.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Phage Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Target Bacteria Population.'

Here's the key question: When phage population goes UP, does
target bacteria population go UP or DOWN?

More phages infecting and lysing target bacteria directly reduces the Target Bacteria Population through predator-prey dynamics.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Target Bacteria Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Phage Replication Rate.'

Here's the key question: When target bacteria population goes UP, does
phage replication rate go UP or DOWN?

More abundant target bacteria provide more hosts for phage replication, increasing Phage Replication Rate — this is the self-amplifying nature of phage therapy.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Phage Specificity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Healthy Microbiome Impact.'

Here's the key question: When phage specificity goes UP, does
healthy microbiome impact go UP or DOWN?

Higher Phage Specificity means the phages more precisely target only the pathogenic bacteria, reducing off-target damage to beneficial gut microbiome species.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Target Bacteria Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Bacterial Resistance Rate.'

Here's the key question: When target bacteria population goes UP, does
bacterial resistance rate go UP or DOWN?

Larger bacterial populations contain more genetic diversity through random mutation, increasing the probability that resistance-conferring mutations exist and are selected for under phage pressure.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 3
positive relationships. 5 arrows total.

Phage therapy has a remarkable feature: the treatment amplifies itself. Unlike antibiotics that degrade after administration, phages replicate inside the very bacteria they're killing. But the bacteria are evolving resistance in real time, and the patient's immune system may clear the phages. How do you optimize Dosage, Timing, and Specificity to win this three-way race?

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Phage Specificity is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — STANDARD PROTOCOL
• Moderate dose, medium specificity, early treatment
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the Phage Population as it encounters a growing bacterial population?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — DELAYED TREATMENT
• Late timing, established bacterial resistance
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the race between Phage Replication Rate and Bacterial Resistance Rate when treatment starts late?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — OPTIMIZED COCKTAIL
• High specificity, high dose, early timing
• PREDICT FIRST: Do you predict that maximizing all three external parameters eliminates bacterial resistance evolution entirely?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Phage therapy is self-amplifying — phage populations grow exponentially when target bacteria are abundant, then decline naturally when the infection clears, making it inherently self-limiting
• Bacterial resistance to phages evolves rapidly but often comes with a fitness cost — resistant bacteria may lose virulence factors or become re-sensitized to antibiotics
• The immune system is both ally and obstacle — it helps clear the infection but may also neutralize therapeutic phages before they complete their work
• Treatment timing is critical because early intervention targets smaller, more genetically homogeneous populations that are less likely to contain pre-existing resistant mutants

THE ANSWER: Bacteriophage therapy works by exploiting the natural predator-prey relationship between viruses and bacteria. Unlike antibiotics, phages are self-amplifying — they reproduce inside the bacteria they kill, so the treatment literally grows as the infection grows. The optimization challenge is a three-way race: phages must kill bacteria faster than bacteria evolve resistance, while the patient's immune system tolerates the phages long enough for them to work. Engineering high-specificity phages, optimizing initial dosage, and treating early in the infection timeline are the key variables. Remarkably, when bacteria evolve resistance to phages, they often lose the very surface receptors that made them antibiotic-resistant in the first place — a phenomenon called phage-antibiotic synergy.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Standard Protocol. Moderate dose, medium specificity, early treatment.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Delayed Treatment.
Late timing, established bacterial resistance.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to the race between Phage Replication Rate and Bacterial Resistance Rate when treatment starts late?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Optimized Cocktail. High specificity, high dose, early timing.
Do you predict that maximizing all three external parameters eliminates bacterial resistance evolution entirely?

Here's what our model reveals: Bacteriophage therapy works by exploiting the natural predator-prey relationship between viruses and bacteria. Unlike antibiotics, phages are self-amplifying — they reproduce inside the bacteria they kill, so the treatment literally grows as the infection grows. The optimization challenge is a three-way race: phages must kill bacteria faster than bacteria evolve resistance, while the patient's immune system tolerates the phages long enough for them to work.

Remarkably, when bacteria evolve resistance to phages, they often lose the very surface receptors that made them antibiotic-resistant in the first place — a phenomenon called phage-antibiotic synergy.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Phage Specificity?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Treatment Timing?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Dosage Optimization?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Phage-Antibiotic Synergy — The phenomenon where bacteria that evolve resistance to phages become re-sensitized to antibiotics, and vice versa — creating a therapeutic one-two punch
   • Biofilm Penetration — The ability of phages to penetrate bacterial biofilms — dense protective communities that antibiotics cannot reach — using phage-encoded depolymerase enzymes
   • Phage Engineering Level — The degree of genetic modification applied to the phage genome — from wild-type phages to CRISPR-enhanced phages with expanded host range and resistance-countering capabilities

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   • Why is phage therapy described as 'self-amplifying' and how does this differ from antibiotic treatment?
   • What trade-offs did you discover between Phage Specificity and treatment speed?
   • How does natural selection drive bacterial resistance to phages, and why might this resistance come with a fitness cost?

Time: 3 min

SLIDE 4: LEVER FRAMEWORK

Do: Preview LEVER steps. Emphasize that phage therapy involves optimizing a dynamic biological system, not just finding the right dose.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS

TEACHER GUIDE: Engineering a Superbug Killer
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson introduces students to predictive modeling and optimization in the context of bacteriophage therapy — one of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics. Biotech skill focus: Predictive modeling and optimization. With antibiotic resistance killing over 1.27 million people annually and the pipeline for new antibiotics nearly dry, phage therapy represents a paradigm shift in infectious disease treatment that students must understand.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS1-2, HS-LS4-2: Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms; construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from natural selection.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
  Students construct evidence-based explanations of phage-bacteria co-evolution and design optimized therapeutic protocols using model-derived data.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function / LS4.B Natural Selection
  Organisms have complex hierarchical structures that determine function; natural selection acts on heritable variation, driving bacterial resistance evolution under phage pressure.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect / Stability and Change
  Students analyze the causal chain from phage infection to bacterial lysis to resistance evolution, and identify conditions that shift the system toward treatment success or failure.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Bacteriophage, Antibiotic Resistance, Phage Specificity, Microbiome
□ Prepare Antibiotics are failing. Can we engineer viruses to kill the superbugs that antibiotics can't discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify nine components spanning phage biology, bacterial evolution, immune response, and treatment parameters — including three externally controllable variables (Phage Specificity, Treatment Timing, Dosage Optimization) and six internal dynamic responses.
• Establish: Students determine that Dosage Optimization establishes the initial Phage Population, which interacts with Target Bacteria Population through predator-prey dynamics while Bacterial Resistance Rate and Immune System Response work against the therapy — and that Phage Specificity controls the trade-off between targeting precision and Healthy Microbiome Impact.
• Visualize: Students build a computational model showing the three-way race between phage replication, bacterial resistance evolution, and immune clearance, with treatment outcome determined by which process dominates.
• Evaluate: Students run standard, delayed-treatment, and optimized-cocktail scenarios to identify the parameter combinations that maximize bacterial clearance while minimizing resistance emergence and microbiome damage.
• Revise: Students add Phage-Antibiotic Synergy, Biofilm Penetration, or Phage Engineering Level to explore advanced therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Antibiotic Resistance Crisis:
  Antibiotic-resistant bacteria kill more people than HIV/AIDS or malaria. The WHO has declared antimicrobial resistance one of the top 10 global public health threats. Resistance arises through natural selection: when antibiotics are used, susceptible bacteria die while naturally resistant mutants survive and reproduce. Hospitals harbor 'superbugs' like MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae), and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis that are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. The pharmaceutical industry has largely abandoned antibiotic development because it's not profitable — a new antibiotic costs $1-2 billion to develop and is used sparingly (to prevent resistance), generating far less revenue than drugs taken daily for chronic conditions.

• Bacteriophage Biology:
  Bacteriophages are viruses that exclusively infect bacteria — they cannot infect human cells because they require bacterial surface receptors for attachment. Phages follow a lytic cycle: (1) attachment to specific bacterial surface receptors, (2) injection of phage DNA into the bacterium, (3) hijacking of bacterial protein synthesis machinery to produce new phage components, (4) assembly of 50-200 new phage particles inside the cell, (5) lysis — the bacterial cell bursts, releasing new phages to infect more bacteria. This specificity is both a strength (precision targeting) and a challenge (each phage only kills specific bacterial strains). Phage cocktails — mixtures of multiple phage types — address this limitation.

• Phage-Bacteria Co-Evolution: The Red Queen Hypothesis:
  Bacteria and phages have been co-evolving for 3.5 billion years in the longest-running arms race on Earth. Bacteria evolve phage resistance primarily by modifying surface receptors (so phages can't attach), producing restriction enzymes (that cut foreign DNA), or using CRISPR-Cas systems (bacterial immune memory). But resistance often comes at a cost: the surface receptors that phages use for attachment are frequently the same receptors bacteria use for virulence or antibiotic resistance. When bacteria modify these receptors to escape phages, they may lose their antibiotic resistance — a phenomenon called 'phage-antibiotic synergy' or 'evolutionary trade-offs.' This creates a therapeutic strategy: use phages to force bacteria into an evolutionary corner where they become vulnerable to antibiotics again.

• Clinical Phage Therapy: From Compassionate Use to Precision Medicine:
  Phage therapy has been used clinically in the Republic of Georgia for over 100 years, but Western medicine largely abandoned it when antibiotics were discovered. Now, with antibiotics failing, phage therapy is experiencing a renaissance. The FDA has approved compassionate-use phage therapy for patients with untreatable infections. Notable cases include Tom Patterson (2016), who survived a multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter infection after personalized phage therapy when all antibiotics failed. Modern phage therapy uses genomic sequencing to match phages to patient-specific bacterial strains, synthetic biology to engineer phages with expanded host ranges, and computational models to optimize dosing and treatment timing. The challenge is that each treatment is essentially a custom-designed biological product — very different from mass-produced antibiotic pills.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Phages are dangerous because they're viruses"
  Reality: Bacteriophages CANNOT infect human cells — period. They require specific bacterial surface receptors that human cells do not have. Phages have been part of the human microbiome since birth; you carry approximately 10^12 phages in your gut right now. They are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and have never caused a human infection. The word 'virus' triggers fear, but phages are fundamentally different from human-infecting viruses.
  Strategy: Ask: What would a phage need to infect a human cell? It would need to recognize human surface receptors — but phage tail proteins evolved over 3.5 billion years to recognize BACTERIAL receptors. That's like trying to use a USB-C cable to charge a gas-powered car.

• "Bacteria can become resistant to everything eventually"
  Reality: While bacteria can evolve resistance to any single selective pressure, resistance always comes at a cost. The model shows that phage resistance often requires modifying surface receptors that serve other essential functions. Phage cocktails (multiple phages targeting different receptors) make it exponentially harder for bacteria to evolve resistance to ALL phages simultaneously — the same principle behind HIV combination therapy.
  Strategy: Calculate: If resistance to one phage occurs at a rate of 1 in 10^6, what's the probability of simultaneous resistance to three phages targeting different receptors? 1 in 10^18 — more bacteria than exist in the patient.

• "We should just develop new antibiotics instead"
  Reality: New antibiotic development has nearly stopped because it's economically unviable — $1-2 billion to develop a drug that's used sparingly and becomes obsolete when resistance emerges. Only 2 new antibiotic classes have been discovered in the last 50 years. Phage therapy offers a fundamentally different approach: instead of chemical warfare against bacteria, it uses a co-evolved biological weapon that adapts alongside its target.
  Strategy: Discuss: Why would a pharmaceutical company prefer to develop a blood pressure medication taken daily for life versus an antibiotic taken for 10 days? Follow the money.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Antibiotics are failing. Can we engineer viruses to kill the superbugs that antibiotics can't?
Answer: Bacteriophage therapy works by exploiting the natural predator-prey relationship between viruses and bacteria. Unlike antibiotics, phages are self-amplifying — they reproduce inside the bacteria they kill, so the treatment literally grows as the infection grows. The optimization challenge is a three-way race: phages must kill bacteria faster than bacteria evolve resistance, while the patient's immune system tolerates the phages long enough for them to work. Engineering high-specificity phages, optimizing initial dosage, and treating early in the infection timeline are the key variables. Remarkably, when bacteria evolve resistance to phages, they often lose the very surface receptors that made them antibiotic-resistant in the first place — a phenomenon called phage-antibiotic synergy.

Simulation Answers:
• Standard Protocol Scenario: With moderate dosage, medium specificity, and early treatment, the Phage Population quickly amplifies using the smaller bacterial population as hosts. Target Bacteria Population drops sharply as phage predation outpaces bacterial reproduction. Bacterial Resistance Rate increases modestly but remains manageable because the population was small at treatment onset. Immune System Response clears remaining phages after bacteria are depleted. Healthy Microbiome Impact is moderate due to medium specificity.
• Optimized Cocktail Scenario: With high specificity, high dose, and early timing, the initial Phage Population is large enough to rapidly overwhelm the bacterial population before significant resistance can evolve. High Phage Specificity dramatically reduces Healthy Microbiome Impact. The key insight is that early timing prevents the bacterial population from reaching the size where resistance-conferring mutations become statistically likely. However, even under optimal conditions, some resistance evolution is observed — the arms race is never fully won.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is phage therapy described as self-amplifying?
  A: Unlike antibiotics — which are administered at a fixed dose and steadily degrade — phages reproduce inside the bacteria they kill. Each lysis event releases 50-200 new phage particles that immediately seek new bacterial hosts. The model shows that Phage Population can increase exponentially when Target Bacteria Population is high, creating a self-reinforcing treatment cycle. When bacteria are eliminated, phages lose their reproduction substrate and the population naturally declines. This makes phage therapy inherently self-limiting — the treatment stops when the infection stops.
• Q: How does natural selection create the resistance trade-off?
  A: The model shows Bacterial Resistance Rate increasing under phage pressure as natural selection favors mutants with modified surface receptors. But these surface receptors serve other bacterial functions — they may be the same proteins used for nutrient uptake, antibiotic efflux, or virulence. When bacteria modify these receptors to escape phages, they may lose these other capabilities. This is the evolutionary trade-off: resistance to phages comes at the cost of fitness in other dimensions, potentially re-sensitizing the bacteria to antibiotics.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Personalized Phage Therapy Protocol
Mission: Design a treatment protocol that matches engineered phage cocktails to specific patient infections, optimizing timing, dosage, and specificity for maximum effectiveness.
Scenario: A biotech startup is developing a phage therapy clinic for patients with antibiotic-resistant infections. Each patient's infection is different — different bacterial strains, different resistance profiles, different immune status. Your team must design the decision-making protocol that determines which phages to use, when to start treatment, and how to adjust the approach if resistance emerges.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A biotech startup is opening a phage therapy clinic for patients with untreatable antibiotic-resistant infections. Each patient's infection is unique. Your team must design the clinical decision-making protocol — from bacterial strain identification through phage selection to treatment monitoring and resistance management.

Key Concepts:
• Personalized Phage Selection: Unlike mass-produced antibiotics, phage therapy can be customized to each patient's specific bacterial infection. Rapid genome sequencing identifies the pathogen; phage libraries are screened for activity; cocktails of 3-5 complementary phages are assembled to reduce resistance risk.
• Treatment Monitoring: Phage therapy requires real-time monitoring of bacterial counts (are they decreasing?), phage titers (are phages replicating?), resistance markers (are bacteria evolving escape?), and patient inflammatory markers (is the immune system interfering?). Computational models predict expected trajectories and flag deviations.
• Resistance Management Strategy: The 'phage-antibiotic synergy' strategy deliberately uses phage therapy to force bacteria to evolve in predictable directions — trading phage resistance for antibiotic susceptibility — then follows up with targeted antibiotics to eliminate the now-vulnerable population.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Protocol includes systematic phage selection, cocktail design rationale, monitoring schedule with specific biomarkers, resistance contingency plan with phage-antibiotic synergy strategy, and model-derived evidence
• Proficient (3): Protocol includes phage selection, monitoring, and basic resistance management based on model findings
• Developing (2): Protocol covers basic treatment steps but lacks monitoring detail or resistance contingency planning
• Beginning (1): Protocol is incomplete or does not connect treatment decisions to the population dynamics model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified phage lytic cycle diagram showing the five steps from attachment to lysis
  • Use predator-prey graph templates (Lotka-Volterra style) where students can sketch predicted population trajectories before simulating
  • Scaffold evolutionary thinking: 'If phages kill all bacteria EXCEPT those with ___ mutation, what happens to the next generation?'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the Tom Patterson case — the first FDA-approved compassionate-use phage therapy in the US — and analyze what made his treatment protocol successful
  • Investigate how CRISPR-enhanced phages are being engineered to overcome bacterial defense systems and expand host range
  • Compare the economic models of phage therapy (personalized per patient) versus antibiotics (mass produced) and debate which is more sustainable

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Model phage-bacteria population dynamics using Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations and compare mathematical predictions to simulation results
  • ELA: Research and write a feature article for a science magazine explaining why phage therapy, abandoned 80 years ago, is making a comeback in the antibiotic resistance crisis
  • Social Studies: Investigate why phage therapy thrived in the Soviet Union/Georgia while the West pursued antibiotics — how do political and economic systems shape scientific priorities?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the population dynamics of bacteriophage-bacteria interactions including immune system interference and resistance evolution
• Optimize phage therapy treatment parameters (timing, dosage, specificity) to maximize pathogen clearance while preserving microbiome health
• Analyze how natural selection drives real-time bacterial resistance to therapeutic phages and evaluate counter-strategies

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A patient's phage therapy is started 5 days after infection instead of 1 day. Based on your model, which outcome is most likely and why?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain the 'arms race' between bacteriophages and bacteria. Why does bacterial resistance to phages sometimes make the bacteria more vulnerable to antibiotics? Reference at least three model components.
