### Title
**Predicting the Next Pandemic — Predictive Modeling of Zoonotic Spillover and Pandemic Emergence**

### Overview
This lesson introduces students to predictive epidemiological modeling — the computational approach that can identify where and when the next pandemic is most likely to emerge. Biotech skill focus: Predictive modeling and optimization. COVID-19 demonstrated both the devastating consequences of failed pandemic prediction and the power of computational models to guide response. Students will build models that identify the conditions under which zoonotic spillover escalates to global catastrophe. Students investigate the driving question: COVID-19 killed millions. The next pandemic is already brewing in a bat cave, a wet market, or an industrial pig farm — can we predict where and when it will emerge? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
9th Grade — Level 3: Biotech

### NGSS Standard
**HS-LS2-6, HS-ETS1-4**: Evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem; use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem.

### Learning Objectives
- Build a predictive model for pandemic emergence that traces the pathway from wildlife-human contact through zoonotic spillover to global spread
- Analyze how wildlife contact rates, viral mutation, surveillance detection, and population connectivity interact to determine pandemic risk
- Predict which conditions are most likely to produce the next pandemic emergence event using multi-variable simulation
- Evaluate early warning surveillance systems and intervention strategies that could prevent the next pandemic before it starts

### Component List (Starting Model: 9 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Wildlife-Human Contact Rate | External | The frequency and intensity of interactions between humans and wild animal species that harbor novel viruses — increased by deforestation, bushmeat hunting, wildlife trade, and agricultural expansion into wild habitats |
| Viral Mutation Rate | Internal | The inherent rate at which the pathogen accumulates genetic changes during replication, some of which may enhance human infectivity, transmissibility, or immune evasion — determined by the virus's replication machinery |
| Zoonotic Spillover Probability | Internal | The calculated likelihood that a virus successfully jumps from animal to human during any given contact event — determined by viral compatibility with human cell receptors, dose of exposure, and individual immune status |
| Surveillance Detection Speed | External | The time between the first human infection and the moment public health authorities detect and identify the novel pathogen — faster detection enables earlier containment |
| Population Density | External | The concentration of people in the geographic area where spillover occurs, which determines how many potential secondary contacts an infected person has before detection |
| Travel Connectivity | External | The number and frequency of transportation links (flights, roads, shipping) connecting the spillover location to other population centers — determines how quickly a local outbreak becomes global |
| Immune Naivety | Internal | The proportion of the human population with zero pre-existing immunity to the novel pathogen — for truly novel zoonotic viruses, this is effectively 100%, enabling explosive epidemic growth |
| Healthcare Capacity | Internal | The ability of the local and national healthcare system to identify, isolate, treat, and contact-trace infected individuals — determines whether early cases are contained or amplified through nosocomial transmission |
| Intervention Speed | Internal | The time between outbreak detection and implementation of effective containment measures — quarantine, travel restrictions, vaccination campaigns, therapeutic deployment — the single most critical determinant of pandemic versus contained outbreak |

PREDICTING THE NEXT PANDEMIC

Predictive Modeling of Zoonotic Spillover and Pandemic Emergence.
COVID-19 killed millions. The next pandemic is already brewing in a bat cave, a wet market, or an industrial pig farm — can we predict where and when it will emerge?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Wildlife-Human Contact Rate" — the frequency and intensity of interactions between humans and wild animal species that harbor novel viruses — increased by deforestation
  ○ Click "Surveillance Detection Speed" — the time between the first human infection and the moment public health authorities detect and identify the novel pathogen — faster detection enables earlier containment
  ○ Click "Population Density" — the concentration of people in the geographic area where spillover occurs
  ○ Click "Travel Connectivity" — the number and frequency of transportation links (flights
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Viral Mutation Rate" — the inherent rate at which the pathogen accumulates genetic changes during replication
  ○ Click "Zoonotic Spillover Probability" — the calculated likelihood that a virus successfully jumps from animal to human during any given contact event — determined by viral compatibility with human cell receptors
  ○ Click "Immune Naivety" — the proportion of the human population with zero pre-existing immunity to the novel pathogen — for truly novel zoonotic viruses
  ○ Click "Healthcare Capacity" — the ability of the local and national healthcare system to identify
  ○ Click "Intervention Speed" — the time between outbreak detection and implementation of effective containment measures — quarantine

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 9 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

"COVID-19 killed millions. The next pandemic is already brewing in a bat cave, a wet market, or an industrial pig farm — can we predict where and when it will emerge?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Wildlife-Human Contact Rate' — that's external. The frequency and intensity of interactions between humans and wild animal species that harbor novel viruses — increased by deforestation.
Click on 'Viral Mutation Rate' — that's internal. The inherent rate at which the pathogen accumulates genetic changes during replication.
Click on 'Zoonotic Spillover Probability' — that's internal. The calculated likelihood that a virus successfully jumps from animal to human during any given contact event — determined by viral compatibility with human cell receptors.
Click on 'Surveillance Detection Speed' — that's external. The time between the first human infection and the moment public health authorities detect and identify the novel pathogen — faster detection enables earlier containment.
Click on 'Population Density' — that's external. The concentration of people in the geographic area where spillover occurs.
Click on 'Travel Connectivity' — that's external. The number and frequency of transportation links (flights.
Click on 'Immune Naivety' — that's internal. The proportion of the human population with zero pre-existing immunity to the novel pathogen — for truly novel zoonotic viruses.
Click on 'Healthcare Capacity' — that's internal. The ability of the local and national healthcare system to identify.
Click on 'Intervention Speed' — that's internal. The time between outbreak detection and implementation of effective containment measures — quarantine.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Wildlife-Human Contact Rate, Surveillance Detection Speed, Population Density, and Travel Connectivity are external components because they represent factors that can be influenced by policy decisions and infrastructure investments — governments can regulate deforestation, fund surveillance systems, manage urban planning, and implement travel screening. Viral Mutation Rate, Zoonotic Spillover Probability, Immune Naivety, Healthcare Capacity, and Intervention Speed are internal components — they are properties of the biological system or emergent responses that cannot be directly set but are influenced by the external conditions.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 9 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Wildlife-Human Contact Rate" and drag an arrow to "Zoonotic Spillover Probability"
• Click on "Viral Mutation Rate" and drag an arrow to "Zoonotic Spillover Probability"
• Click on "Population Density" and drag an arrow to "Intervention Speed"
• Click on "Travel Connectivity" and drag an arrow to "Geographic Spread Rate"
• Click on "Surveillance Detection Speed" and drag an arrow to "Intervention Speed"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Wildlife-Human Contact Rate → Zoonotic Spillover Probability = POSITIVE (+)
    More frequent contact between humans and wildlife creates more opportunities for cross-species viral transmission — each contact event is a probabilistic opportunity for spillover.

  ○ Viral Mutation Rate → Zoonotic Spillover Probability = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher viral mutation rate generates more genetic variants, increasing the probability that a human-compatible variant emerges that can infect human cells and achieve human-to-human transmission.

  ○ Population Density → Intervention Speed = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher population density makes containment more difficult because infected individuals have more contacts before isolation, increasing the number of cases that must be traced and requiring more resources for intervention.

  ○ Travel Connectivity → Geographic Spread Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More transportation links from the outbreak origin accelerate the geographic spread of the pathogen to new population centers, reducing the time window for containment.

  ○ Surveillance Detection Speed → Intervention Speed = POSITIVE (+)
    Faster surveillance detection enables faster intervention — you cannot contain what you haven't detected. Every day of detection delay exponentially increases the infected population that must be contained.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 5 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 4 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: Wildlife-Human Contact Rate is increasing every year as deforestation pushes humans deeper into animal habitats. Each contact event has a small Zoonotic Spillover Probability that depends on Viral Mutation Rate producing a human-compatible variant. Once spillover occurs, the race begins: Surveillance Detection Speed versus Population Density and Travel Connectivity determine whether the world catches it early or learns about it after it's already everywhere. What combination of conditions turns a single sick person in a remote village into a global catastrophe?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Wildlife-Human Contact Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Zoonotic Spillover Probability.'

Here's the key question: When wildlife-human contact rate goes UP, does
zoonotic spillover probability go UP or DOWN?

More frequent contact between humans and wildlife creates more opportunities for cross-species viral transmission — each contact event is a probabilistic opportunity for spillover.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Viral Mutation Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Zoonotic Spillover Probability.'

Here's the key question: When viral mutation rate goes UP, does
zoonotic spillover probability go UP or DOWN?

Higher viral mutation rate generates more genetic variants, increasing the probability that a human-compatible variant emerges that can infect human cells and achieve human-to-human transmission.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Population Density' and drag an arrow
over to 'Intervention Speed.'

Here's the key question: When population density goes UP, does
intervention speed go UP or DOWN?

Higher population density makes containment more difficult because infected individuals have more contacts before isolation, increasing the number of cases that must be traced and requiring more resources for intervention.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Travel Connectivity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Geographic Spread Rate.'

Here's the key question: When travel connectivity goes UP, does
geographic spread rate go UP or DOWN?

More transportation links from the outbreak origin accelerate the geographic spread of the pathogen to new population centers, reducing the time window for containment.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Final connection: Click on 'Surveillance Detection Speed' and drag an arrow
over to 'Intervention Speed.'

Here's the key question: When surveillance detection speed goes UP, does
intervention speed go UP or DOWN?

Faster surveillance detection enables faster intervention — you cannot contain what you haven't detected. Every day of detection delay exponentially increases the infected population that must be contained.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 4
positive relationships. 5 arrows total.

Wildlife-Human Contact Rate is increasing every year as deforestation pushes humans deeper into animal habitats. Each contact event has a small Zoonotic Spillover Probability that depends on Viral Mutation Rate producing a human-compatible variant. Once spillover occurs, the race begins: Surveillance Detection Speed versus Population Density and Travel Connectivity determine whether the world catches it early or learns about it after it's already everywhere. What combination of conditions turns a single sick person in a remote village into a global catastrophe?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Wildlife-Human Contact Rate is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — SLOW BURN
• Moderate contact, average mutation, moderate surveillance
• PREDICT FIRST: How many spillover events do you predict will occur before one leads to sustained human-to-human transmission?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — COVID-19 ANALOG
• High contact, high density, high travel, slow detection
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict the infection curve looks like when surveillance is slow and travel connectivity is high?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — EARLY WARNING OPTIMIZED
• Fast surveillance, moderate risk factors
• PREDICT FIRST: Do you predict that fast detection alone can prevent a pandemic, even if all other risk factors are elevated?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Zoonotic spillover events happen far more frequently than pandemics — most cross-species jumps lead to dead-end infections that don't transmit between humans, but each one is a roll of the evolutionary dice
• The critical window for containment is extremely narrow — once a novel virus achieves sustained human-to-human transmission in a connected population, pandemic spread is nearly inevitable with current infrastructure
• Surveillance detection speed is the single most impactful intervention point — the difference between detecting an outbreak in week 1 versus week 4 can mean the difference between 100 cases and 100,000 cases
• Pandemic risk is not random — it clusters in predictable geographic hotspots where high wildlife diversity, rapid deforestation, dense human populations, and limited healthcare infrastructure overlap

THE ANSWER: Pandemics are not random acts of nature — they emerge through a predictable sequence of events that can be modeled and potentially prevented. Wildlife-human contact creates opportunities for zoonotic spillover. Viral mutation generates variants capable of human infection. Population density and travel connectivity determine whether a local outbreak goes global. The model reveals that the most impactful intervention is surveillance — detecting novel outbreaks within days rather than weeks. COVID-19 demonstrated that a delay of just a few weeks in detection and response transformed a containable outbreak in one city into a global pandemic that killed millions. Predictive models can identify the geographic hotspots, seasonal windows, and viral lineages most likely to produce the next pandemic — enabling preemptive surveillance deployment rather than reactive response.

"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Slow Burn. Moderate contact, average mutation, moderate surveillance.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: COVID-19 Analog.
High contact, high density, high travel, slow detection.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict the infection curve looks like when surveillance is slow and travel connectivity is high?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Early Warning Optimized. Fast surveillance, moderate risk factors.
Do you predict that fast detection alone can prevent a pandemic, even if all other risk factors are elevated?

Here's what our model reveals: Pandemics are not random acts of nature — they emerge through a predictable sequence of events that can be modeled and potentially prevented. Wildlife-human contact creates opportunities for zoonotic spillover. Viral mutation generates variants capable of human infection. Population density and travel connectivity determine whether a local outbreak goes global.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Wildlife-Human Contact Rate?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Surveillance Detection Speed?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Population Density?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Travel Connectivity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Seasonal Climate Patterns — Temperature and precipitation cycles that affect wildlife breeding, migration, and habitat overlap with human populations — creating predictable seasonal windows of elevated spillover risk
   • Viral Recombination Events — The exchange of genetic material between different viral strains co-infecting the same host cell, which can rapidly create novel viruses with pandemic potential — especially concerning in intermediate hosts like pigs
   • Global Supply Chain Disruption — The cascade of economic, food security, and social consequences that follow pandemic-related lockdowns and travel restrictions — the secondary disaster that amplifies the human toll beyond direct disease mortality

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Zoonotic Spillover: Where Pandemics Begin — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Pandemic Prediction Problem — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does your predictive model identify the conditions that distinguish a contained outbreak from a global pandemic?
   • Which intervention point in your model has the greatest leverage for preventing pandemics — why is surveillance speed so critical?
   • Why do you think pandemic risk is concentrated in specific geographic hotspots rather than distributed randomly?
   • How would adding Seasonal Climate Patterns change your model's ability to predict spillover timing?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?

"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 9 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Seasonal Climate Patterns. Temperature and precipitation cycles that affect wildlife breeding, migration, and habitat overlap with human populations — creating predictable seasonal windows of elevated spillover risk
How would you model that?

Viral Recombination Events. The exchange of genetic material between different viral strains co-infecting the same host cell, which can rapidly create novel viruses with pandemic potential — especially concerning in intermediate hosts like pigs
How would you model that?

Global Supply Chain Disruption. The cascade of economic, food security, and social consequences that follow pandemic-related lockdowns and travel restrictions — the secondary disaster that amplifies the human toll beyond direct disease mortality
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

### PowerPoint Slides

```
SLIDE 1: COVER
Visual: Title slide with dramatic global pandemic risk map and COVID-19 timeline
Say: "COVID-19 was not a surprise to epidemiologists — they had been warning about exactly this scenario for decades. The virus, the location, even the timing were all predictable in hindsight. Today you're going to build the model that predicts the next one."
Do: Show a timeline of pandemic warnings that were ignored before COVID-19. Let students process the pattern.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 2: LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Visual: Learning goals and pandemic science vocabulary
Say: "You're going to build a predictive model for pandemic emergence — the same type of computational tool that organizations like the WHO and CDC use to assess global health threats."
Do: Pre-teach zoonotic spillover and immune naivety. Show a simple animation of a virus jumping from bat to human to illustrate the spillover concept.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 3: BIG QUESTION
Visual: The next pandemic is already brewing — can we predict where?
Say: "Somewhere in the world right now, a virus is mutating inside an animal. One day — maybe tomorrow, maybe in ten years — it will jump into a human. What determines whether that becomes a footnote or a catastrophe?"
Do: Think-pair-share: Students list conditions that would make a spillover event more likely to become a pandemic. Compile and categorize.
Time: 3 min

SLIDE 4: LEVER FRAMEWORK
Visual: LEVER steps with pandemic prediction context
Say: "We're building a predictive model — one that identifies WHERE pandemics are most likely to start and WHAT conditions enable their spread. This is proactive science."
Do: Preview LEVER steps. Distinguish between prediction (knowing the future) and preparedness (being ready for it). Both require models.
Time: 2 min

SLIDE 5: ACTIVITY 1: COMPONENTS
Visual: Nine component cards spanning ecology, virology, and public health
Say: "Four of these components are things governments can actually control — investments they can make RIGHT NOW to prevent the next pandemic. Which four? And which five are determined by nature?"
Do: Guide sorting of external versus internal components. Emphasize that the controllable variables represent policy decisions — funding surveillance, managing wildlife contact, regulating travel.
Time: 8 min

SLIDE 6: ACTIVITY 2: CONNECTIONS
Visual: Causal chain from wildlife contact to global pandemic
Say: "Trace the pathway from a bat in a cave to a global pandemic. Every link in this chain is a potential intervention point — a place where we could break the chain if we were watching."
Do: Students map the full causal chain. Identify which connections represent the best intervention points (surveillance, containment) versus immutable factors (viral mutation rate).
Time: 8 min

SLIDE 7: ACTIVITY 3: SIMULATION
Visual: Pandemic probability dashboards and outbreak trajectory projections
Say: "Run these three scenarios and find the answer: Can we prevent the next pandemic if we invest in the right interventions — or are pandemics inevitable?"
Do: Students predict outcomes, then run all three scenarios. Compare pandemic probability across scenarios, focusing on how surveillance speed changes outcomes.
Time: 10 min

SLIDE 8: DISCOVERIES
Visual: Key predictive findings and surveillance evidence
Say: "Your model shows what epidemiologists have been saying for years: pandemics are predictable and preventable — but only if we invest in surveillance BEFORE the next one starts, not after."
Do: Connect model findings to COVID-19 timeline. Show how early detection could have changed the trajectory. Discuss why surveillance funding was cut before the pandemic.
Time: 5 min

SLIDE 9: STEM CHALLENGE
Visual: Global pandemic early warning system design challenge
Say: "The WHO just hired your team. Design the surveillance system that detects the next pandemic virus within 72 hours of the first human case. This is the most important engineering challenge of our generation."
Do: Groups design early warning systems including data streams, detection algorithms, alert protocols, and deployment strategies for resource-limited settings. Present and evaluate.
Time: 12 min

TEACHER GUIDE: Predicting the Next Pandemic
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson introduces students to predictive epidemiological modeling — the computational approach that can identify where and when the next pandemic is most likely to emerge. Biotech skill focus: Predictive modeling and optimization. COVID-19 demonstrated both the devastating consequences of failed pandemic prediction and the power of computational models to guide response. Students will build models that identify the conditions under which zoonotic spillover escalates to global catastrophe.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
HS-LS2-6, HS-ETS1-4: Evaluate claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem; use a computer simulation to model the impact of proposed solutions to a complex real-world problem.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
  Students use computational simulation to model the probabilistic chain of events from zoonotic spillover to pandemic emergence, varying parameters to predict outbreak trajectories.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics / ETS1.B Developing Possible Solutions
  Changing conditions in ecosystems affect organism interactions; engineering solutions to pandemic preparedness require modeling complex, multi-variable systems.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect / Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
  Students trace the causal chain from local wildlife contact to global pandemic, analyzing how small changes in early-stage parameters produce vastly different outcomes at global scale.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Zoonotic Spillover, Viral Mutation Rate, Immune Naivety, Pandemic Preparedness
□ Prepare COVID-19 killed millions. The next pandemic is already brewing in a bat cave, a wet market, or an industrial pig farm — can we predict where and when it will emerge discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify nine components spanning ecological (Wildlife-Human Contact Rate), virological (Viral Mutation Rate, Zoonotic Spillover Probability), epidemiological (Population Density, Immune Naivety, Travel Connectivity), and public health (Surveillance Detection Speed, Healthcare Capacity, Intervention Speed) domains.
• Establish: Students determine that Wildlife-Human Contact Rate creates spillover opportunities, Viral Mutation Rate generates human-compatible variants, and the chain from Zoonotic Spillover Probability through Population Density and Travel Connectivity to global spread is modulated by Surveillance Detection Speed, Healthcare Capacity, and Intervention Speed.
• Visualize: Students build a predictive model connecting the spillover-to-pandemic pathway, visualizing how changes in surveillance and connectivity parameters shift the probability of pandemic emergence.
• Evaluate: Students run slow-burn, COVID-19-analog, and optimized-early-warning scenarios to identify the parameter combinations that produce pandemics versus contained outbreaks.
• Revise: Students add Seasonal Climate Patterns, Viral Recombination Events, or Global Supply Chain Disruption to explore more realistic and consequential pandemic dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Zoonotic Spillover: Where Pandemics Begin:
  Approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic — they originate in animals. HIV came from chimpanzees, Ebola from bats, SARS-CoV-1 from civets (originally bats), MERS from camels (originally bats), COVID-19 likely from bats (possibly through an intermediate host). The spillover process requires three conditions: contact (humans must encounter infected animals), compatibility (the virus must be able to infect human cells), and transmission (the virus must be able to spread between humans). Most zoonotic spillover events are dead ends — the virus infects one person and stops. But occasionally, mutation or recombination produces a variant that achieves sustained human-to-human transmission, and a pandemic is born. The PREDICT project identified over 1,000 novel viruses in wildlife, including 160+ coronaviruses, before it was defunded in 2019 — months before COVID-19 emerged.

• The Pandemic Prediction Problem:
  Pandemic emergence is a low-probability, high-consequence event that follows a multi-step stochastic process. Each step has its own probability: the chance of a spillover event during any given contact (~0.001-1%), the chance that the virus achieves human-to-human transmission (~0.1-10% of spillover events), the chance of sustained transmission before containment (~10-50% depending on response speed), and the chance of global spread (~50-90% once sustained transmission is established in a connected population). Predictive models don't forecast specific pandemic dates — they identify the conditions, locations, and viral families where the compound probability is highest. This is analogous to earthquake prediction: we can't say exactly when, but we can identify the fault lines.

• Surveillance: The Critical Intervention Window:
  The single most important determinant of pandemic prevention is surveillance speed — the time between the first human case and public health detection. COVID-19 circulated in Wuhan for an estimated 4-8 weeks before being identified and reported. By that time, the virus had infected thousands and spread to multiple countries through air travel. Models consistently show that detecting and responding to a novel pathogen within the first week of human cases — when the infected population is still small and geographically contained — can reduce pandemic probability by 90%+. Modern surveillance tools include wastewater genomic monitoring (detecting viral RNA in sewage before clinical cases are reported), syndromic surveillance (AI analysis of hospital admissions and symptom patterns), and metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples (identifying any pathogen, known or novel, directly from patient specimens).

• Pandemic Risk Mapping: Predicting Hotspots:
  The geographic distribution of pandemic risk is not random — it clusters in predictable hotspots. The highest-risk zones are tropical and subtropical regions with high wildlife biodiversity (especially bat species diversity), rapid deforestation and agricultural expansion (increasing wildlife-human contact), dense human populations near wildlife interfaces, live animal markets, intensive livestock farming (particularly pigs, which can serve as 'mixing vessels' for influenza reassortment), limited public health surveillance infrastructure, and high international travel connectivity. South and Southeast Asia, Central and West Africa, and parts of South America are consistently identified as the highest-risk regions. Predictive models integrate these risk factors into geographic risk maps that can guide targeted surveillance deployment.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Pandemics are unpredictable 'acts of God'"
  Reality: Pandemics follow a predictable sequence: zoonotic spillover, adaptation to human transmission, spread through connected populations. The specific pathogen and exact timing are uncertain, but the geographic hotspots, risk factors, and transmission dynamics are well understood. Epidemiologists predicted a novel coronavirus pandemic from a bat reservoir in a densely populated Asian region years before COVID-19 — the surprise was not THAT it happened but that the world wasn't ready.
  Strategy: Timeline exercise: Show students the published pandemic predictions from 2015-2018 that described almost exactly what happened in 2020. Ask: Was this unpredictable, or was it unheeded?

• "COVID-19 was a once-in-a-century event"
  Reality: The frequency of pandemic-potential zoonotic spillover events is INCREASING, not decreasing. Deforestation is accelerating wildlife-human contact. Climate change is shifting animal ranges. Global travel connectivity is increasing. Industrial livestock farming creates massive pathogen amplification opportunities. The conditions that produced COVID-19 are more common today than they were in 2019, making the next pandemic more likely, not less.
  Strategy: Data point: Novel zoonotic virus discoveries have increased 4-fold since 1980. Ask: What's changed in the world since 1980 that would explain this trend?

• "We just need better drugs and vaccines to stop pandemics"
  Reality: Drugs and vaccines are response tools — they help AFTER a pandemic has started. By the time a vaccine is developed, tested, manufactured, and distributed (12-18 months minimum), millions may already be infected. The model shows that prevention through surveillance and early containment is orders of magnitude more effective and cheaper than response. The COVID-19 vaccine was the fastest ever developed, yet 5 million people died before it was widely available.
  Strategy: Compare costs: Global pandemic surveillance costs ~$4 billion/year. COVID-19 cost the global economy ~$16 TRILLION. Which investment makes more sense?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: COVID-19 killed millions. The next pandemic is already brewing in a bat cave, a wet market, or an industrial pig farm — can we predict where and when it will emerge?
Answer: Pandemics are not random acts of nature — they emerge through a predictable sequence of events that can be modeled and potentially prevented. Wildlife-human contact creates opportunities for zoonotic spillover. Viral mutation generates variants capable of human infection. Population density and travel connectivity determine whether a local outbreak goes global. The model reveals that the most impactful intervention is surveillance — detecting novel outbreaks within days rather than weeks. COVID-19 demonstrated that a delay of just a few weeks in detection and response transformed a containable outbreak in one city into a global pandemic that killed millions. Predictive models can identify the geographic hotspots, seasonal windows, and viral lineages most likely to produce the next pandemic — enabling preemptive surveillance deployment rather than reactive response.

Simulation Answers:
• COVID-19 Analog Scenario: With high Wildlife-Human Contact Rate, high Population Density, high Travel Connectivity, and slow Surveillance Detection Speed, the model predicts explosive pandemic emergence. Zoonotic Spillover Probability generates periodic successful jumps to humans, and once sustained transmission begins in a dense, connected population, global spread occurs within weeks. Immune Naivety near 100% means the entire population is susceptible. Healthcare Capacity is quickly overwhelmed. This closely mirrors the COVID-19 trajectory where weeks of undetected transmission in a high-density, internationally connected city enabled global spread before meaningful intervention.
• Early Warning Optimized Scenario: With maximized Surveillance Detection Speed but otherwise moderate risk conditions, the model shows that early detection dramatically changes outcomes. When a novel pathogen is identified within 3 days of the first human case, the infected population is still small enough for aggressive contact tracing and isolation to contain the outbreak. Healthcare Capacity is not overwhelmed because case numbers remain manageable. The critical insight is that surveillance speed has outsized impact — it's the highest-leverage intervention point in the pandemic pathway.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is surveillance speed the most impactful intervention?
  A: The model reveals that epidemic growth is exponential — each infected person infects multiple others, who each infect multiple others. The infected population doubles on a timescale determined by the pathogen's generation time (2-7 days for most respiratory viruses). This means a 1-week detection delay doesn't just add one week of cases — it allows multiple doubling events. If the doubling time is 3 days, a 3-week delay means the infected population is 2^7 = 128 times larger than it would have been with immediate detection. Containment that would have required tracing 10 contacts now requires tracing 1,280.
• Q: Why do pandemics cluster in predictable hotspots?
  A: Pandemic risk is the product of multiple independent factors, all of which must align for a pandemic to emerge. Tropical forests have the highest bat diversity (and bats are the reservoir for most pandemic-potential viruses). Deforestation in these regions increases wildlife-human contact. Dense populations near these interfaces provide fuel for transmission. Limited healthcare infrastructure delays detection. International airports enable global spread. The hotspots are where ALL of these factors overlap simultaneously — South and Southeast Asia, Central and West Africa, and parts of South America.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Global Pandemic Early Warning System
Mission: Design a surveillance network that detects zoonotic spillover events within 72 hours of the first human infection, anywhere on Earth.
Scenario: The World Health Organization has commissioned your team to design the next-generation pandemic early warning system. COVID-19 demonstrated that existing surveillance was too slow — the virus circulated for weeks or months before being identified. Your system must detect novel zoonotic viruses within 72 hours of the first human case, in any country, regardless of local healthcare infrastructure.
Introduction: Present the challenge: The World Health Organization has commissioned your team to design the next-generation Global Pandemic Early Warning System. COVID-19 proved that existing surveillance was inadequate. Your system must detect novel zoonotic pathogens within 72 hours of the first human case, anywhere on Earth, and trigger a rapid containment response.

Key Concepts:
• Wastewater Genomic Surveillance: Analyzing sewage for pathogen RNA provides population-level data without requiring individual testing. A single wastewater sample can detect a novel virus circulating in a community days before clinical cases are reported — it's the fastest passive surveillance technology available.
• Metagenomic Sequencing: Rather than testing for specific known pathogens, metagenomic sequencing analyzes ALL genetic material in a sample — identifying any virus, bacterium, or parasite present, including completely novel organisms. This is the only surveillance approach that can detect a pathogen that hasn't been discovered yet.
• Network Analysis for Outbreak Prediction: Pandemic models use airline flight data, mobile phone movement patterns, and trade networks to predict how a pathogen would spread from any given starting location. These network models can identify 'superspreader' locations — airports and transportation hubs that would amplify global spread.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): System includes multiple complementary surveillance streams, AI-powered anomaly detection, rapid genomic sequencing capacity, international reporting protocols, and deployment strategy for low-resource settings, supported by model-derived evidence for design choices
• Proficient (3): System includes surveillance technology selection, detection protocol, and alert system with reasoning connected to model findings
• Developing (2): System covers basic surveillance concepts but lacks detail on detection technology or international coordination
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or does not connect surveillance design to the pandemic prediction model

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified spillover pathway diagram showing the steps from animal reservoir to global pandemic
  • Use an epidemic curve template where students can sketch predicted outbreak trajectories for different surveillance speed scenarios
  • Scaffold predictive thinking: 'The risk is highest when ___ AND ___ AND ___ because each factor multiplies the probability of ___.'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the Global Virome Project — the effort to identify every virus on Earth before the next pandemic — and evaluate its feasibility and impact potential
  • Investigate how climate change is expanding the geographic range of disease vectors (mosquitoes, ticks) and creating new pandemic risk zones
  • Compare the surveillance systems that detected SARS (2003, contained in 8 months) versus COVID-19 (2019, became a pandemic) and identify what was different

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate compound probabilities of spillover → transmission → pandemic using the model's parameter values, and determine how much each intervention reduces total pandemic probability
  • ELA: Write a policy brief to Congress arguing for increased pandemic preparedness funding, using model predictions and COVID-19 as evidence of the consequences of underfunding
  • Social Studies: Analyze how global inequality affects pandemic risk — why do most pandemics originate in regions with the least surveillance infrastructure, and what does this mean for global health equity?

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Model the multi-step pathway from zoonotic spillover through sustained human transmission to global pandemic emergence
• Analyze how surveillance speed, population connectivity, and immune naivety interact to determine whether an outbreak becomes a pandemic
• Predict pandemic risk hotspots by identifying geographic regions where wildlife contact, population density, and limited surveillance overlap

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A novel virus is detected in a remote village 4 weeks after the first case, compared to a scenario where it's detected in 3 days. Based on your model, how does this delay affect pandemic probability?
• Constructed Response: Using your predictive model, explain why deforestation in tropical regions increases pandemic risk. Trace the full causal chain from land-use change to potential pandemic emergence, referencing at least three model components.
