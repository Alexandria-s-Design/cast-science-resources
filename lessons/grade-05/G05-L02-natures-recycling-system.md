### Title
**Nature's Recycling System — Why Earth Doesn't Fill Up with Dead Stuff**

### Overview
Students model Earth's decomposition cycle — the invisible system that breaks down dead leaves, fallen trees, and animal remains and returns their nutrients to living things. By building a cause-and-effect model of decomposer activity, students discover that nature runs the world's most efficient recycling operation, and what happens when the system slows down. This lesson anchors the matter cycling standard in a funny, surprising question that Gen Alpha students immediately want to answer.

### Cover Image

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-LS2-1**: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify decomposers as a key component of matter cycling in ecosystems
- Model how soil moisture and organic matter input affect decomposer activity
- Trace how dead matter is converted into nutrients available for living plants
- Predict what happens to an ecosystem when decomposer activity slows down

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Dead Organic Matter | External | Leaves, fallen trees, dead animals — inputs students can't control |
| Soil Moisture | External | Rainfall and water content that enables decomposer survival |
| Decomposer Activity | Internal | Bacteria, fungi, and worms actively breaking down dead material |
| Nutrient Release | Internal | Nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon returning to soil for plants to use |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Decomposition System

### Text Editor

```
NATURE'S RECYCLING SYSTEM

Here's a question nobody asks: Why doesn't Earth fill up with dead stuff?

Think about it. Billions of animals die every year. Every tree that falls.
Every leaf that drops. Every bug that stops buzzing. Where does it all GO?

The answer: decomposers. The most underrated living things on Earth.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Dead Organic Matter" — nature produces this constantly
  ○ Click "Soil Moisture" — rainfall controls this, not us
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Decomposer Activity" — this changes based on conditions
  ○ Click "Nutrient Release" — this is what we're trying to understand

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas
• You should now see 4 components on your screen

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Identify which are EXTERNAL (inputs to the system)
• Identify which are INTERNAL (respond to other components)
• Your teacher will explain this in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You've got the pieces. Now let's figure out how they're connected —
and why without them, Earth would be buried in dead stuff by now.
```

### Video Script

```
"Quick question. Billions of animals die every year. Every tree that
falls. Every leaf that drops. Every fish that sinks.

Where does it all go?

Seriously — if you just pile up dead things, you'd fill the entire
planet in a few thousand years. But that hasn't happened. Why not?

The answer is decomposers. Bacteria. Fungi. Earthworms. The invisible
recycling crew that breaks down every dead thing and returns its
nutrients to the living world.

Today you're going to model how this system actually works. And spoiler:
it's one of the most important cycles on Earth — and almost nobody
talks about it.

Look at the component panel on the right side of your screen.

Dead Organic Matter — that's external. Nature produces it constantly.
Dead leaves, dead animals, fallen trees. We can't stop it.

Soil Moisture — also external. This is rainfall and water content in
the soil. Decomposers need moisture to survive.

Decomposer Activity — internal. This changes based on conditions. Give
decomposers food and moisture? They go wild. Take it away? They slow down.

Nutrient Release — internal. This is the end product. When decomposers
break down dead stuff, they release nutrients that plants can use.

Sort your components: which are external? Which are internal? Then
click the Plus button to add each one to your canvas.

You've got nature's recycling crew ready to go. Now let's wire them
together and see why Earth doesn't smell like one giant compost pile.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Decomposition Chain

### Text Editor

```
WIRING THE RECYCLING MACHINE

Dead stuff goes IN. Nutrients come OUT. But what happens in between?

That's where the decomposers come in — and your model is about to
show exactly how they make it work.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Dead Organic Matter → Decomposer Activity
• Soil Moisture → Decomposer Activity
• Decomposer Activity → Nutrient Release

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• For each arrow, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Dead Organic Matter → Decomposer Activity = POSITIVE (+)
    More dead stuff = MORE food for decomposers = more decomposers

  ○ Soil Moisture → Decomposer Activity = POSITIVE (+)
    Wetter soil = MORE decomposer activity (they need water to survive)

  ○ Decomposer Activity → Nutrient Release = POSITIVE (+)
    More decomposer work = MORE nutrients released to the soil

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• All 3 are POSITIVE relationships
• This is your recycling chain!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Notice: there are no negative relationships here. When conditions
are right, EVERYTHING goes up together. That's a healthy ecosystem.
But what happens when one component crashes?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your decomposition system is on the canvas. Now let's wire the
recycling machine together.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left. Connection mode activated.

First relationship: Click 'Dead Organic Matter' and drag an arrow to
'Decomposer Activity.' When there's MORE dead stuff, do decomposers
have MORE or LESS to eat?

More food, more decomposers! That's POSITIVE. Click the plus sign.

Second: Connect 'Soil Moisture' to 'Decomposer Activity.' Here's
the key biology — bacteria and fungi need moisture to survive. Dry
soil? They go dormant. Wet soil? They multiply.

More moisture = MORE activity. Positive again.

Third: Connect 'Decomposer Activity' to 'Nutrient Release.' When
decomposers are working hard, what happens to the nutrients in
dead material? They get broken down and released into the soil.

More activity = more nutrients released. Positive.

Look at your model. Three arrows. All positive. This is what a
healthy recycling system looks like. When dead matter arrives and
moisture is present, the whole chain lights up.

But here's the thing — what happens if we shut off the moisture?
What happens in a desert, or during a drought? The recycling
machine SLOWS DOWN.

We're about to find out what that looks like.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Recycling System

### Text Editor

```
LET'S SEE NATURE'S RECYCLER IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's test whether your model
works like Earth's actual decomposition system.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• When Dead Organic Matter is HIGH, what happens to Decomposer Activity?
• When Decomposer Activity is HIGH, what happens to Nutrient Release?

STEP 3: SIMULATE A DROUGHT
• Find the LOCK icon next to "Soil Moisture"
• Set Soil Moisture to 0% (drought conditions)
• What happens to Decomposer Activity?
• What happens to Nutrient Release?
• What happens to Dead Organic Matter over time? (hint: it starts piling up)

STEP 4: BRING BACK THE RAIN
• Unlock Soil Moisture
• Watch how fast the system recovers
• Can you see the decomposers "catching up" on all that piled-up matter?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• What happens to a forest ecosystem when decomposers slow down?
• If nutrients stop being released, what happens to living plants?
• Why do forests on moist tropical islands have almost no dead material on the ground?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your recycling machine is built. Let's flip it on.

Click the Play button. Watch the graph. When Dead Organic Matter is
high and Soil Moisture is present, watch what happens to Decomposer
Activity — it climbs. More food, more moisture, more work being done.

And as Decomposer Activity goes up? Nutrient Release goes up too.
The recycling chain is running smoothly.

This is what a healthy forest floor looks like. Dead leaves don't pile up
forever. Decomposers process them within months, sometimes weeks.
Nutrients get released. Plants absorb them. Life continues.

Now let's break it. Find the lock icon next to Soil Moisture.
Click it. Set it to zero.

Drought. No rain. No moisture in the soil.

Watch Decomposer Activity. It drops. Bacteria go dormant. Fungi
retreat. The recycling crew went on break.

And look at what's happening to Dead Organic Matter. It's piling
up. Because the recyclers aren't working.

And Nutrient Release? Crashing. Plants can't get nutrients if
decomposers aren't releasing them.

This is what happens in desert ecosystems. Dead material accumulates
because there's not enough moisture to keep decomposers active.

Now unlock Soil Moisture. Bring the rain back. Watch the system
recover — the decomposers come back to life and start chewing
through that backed-up pile of dead matter.

This is Earth's recycling system. And it runs on something as
simple as moisture.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT THE REAL SYSTEM IS RICHER

Your decomposition model captures the basics. But Earth's actual
recycling system involves thousands of species all working together.

Time to play, dig deeper, and make your model more powerful.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation with drought conditions
   • Explain to a partner what's happening at the microscopic level
   • What are the bacteria doing? Where did the earthworms go?

2. EXTREME CONDITIONS
   • What if Dead Organic Matter drops to zero? (a cleared field)
   • What if Soil Moisture is maxed out but no dead matter arrives?
   • When does Nutrient Release hit its highest point?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real decomposition involves much more. Think:

   • Temperature — decomposers work faster in warmth. How would this connect?
   • Earthworms — they shred material before bacteria can process it
   • pH of Soil — acidic soil slows down certain bacteria
   • Human Composting — what we do in our backyards follows these same rules
   • Time — some materials (plastic) decomposers can't break down at all

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What is the nitrogen cycle and how do decomposers drive it?
   • How does matter move through a food web?
   • What is the difference between producers, consumers, and decomposers?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How long does it take for a leaf to decompose in a tropical rainforest vs. a desert?
   • What are mycorrhizal fungi and how do they connect trees?
   • Why is composting considered "sustainable" farming?
   • What happens to decomposition rates as climate change warms the planet?

   • USDA Natural Resources: nrcs.usda.gov
   • NASA Climate Kids: climatekids.nasa.gov
   • National Geographic Education: education.nationalgeographic.org

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new factor from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model and connect with +/− relationships
   • Run the simulation — does it behave the way you expected?

What story does your upgraded model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your recycling machine works. Moisture goes in, dead matter gets
processed, nutrients come out. But honestly? We barely scratched
the surface of what's actually happening under your feet.

A single teaspoon of healthy soil contains more than ONE BILLION
living organisms. Bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes — an entire
city of recyclers working 24/7. Your model has four components.
Reality has millions.

So let's expand it.

First challenge: break the system in both directions. What if
Dead Organic Matter drops to zero? Maybe the field was cleared.
No leaves, no fallen trees. Watch Decomposer Activity drop.
What happens to Nutrient Release?

Now try maxing out Soil Moisture with no dead matter. Can
decomposers make nutrients without raw material to process?

Second: think about what's MISSING.

Temperature. Decomposers in cold climates work much slower —
that's why decomposition in the Arctic takes years. In a tropical
rainforest? A dead leaf is gone in weeks.

Earthworms. They shred material into smaller pieces so bacteria
can process it faster. They're the first step in the chain.

Human composting — your backyard compost bin follows these same
rules. You add organic matter, keep it moist, and the decomposers
do the rest.

Pick ONE of these. Research it. Add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? What does it connect to? Is it a
positive or negative relationship?

Run the simulation. Does your new component change the story?

The scientists who study soil health use models almost exactly
like this one. They're trying to protect the topsoil that grows
most of the world's food. Your model is the same logic.

What does YOUR expanded recycling system look like?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌱 CAREER CONNECTION: SOIL SCIENTIST / BIOREMEDIATION SPECIALIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Soil Scientists study the living communities inside the ground — the
same decomposers you modeled today. They work to protect topsoil from
erosion, restore farmland that's been damaged by chemicals, and help
communities rebuild healthy soil after industrial pollution.

Bioremediation Specialists take this a step further: they actually use
bacteria and fungi (decomposers!) to clean up contaminated sites. Oil
spills, toxic waste, industrial chemicals — certain microbes can break
these down naturally. These scientists find the right decomposers,
create the right conditions, and let nature do the cleanup.

💰 SALARY: $75,000 - $120,000 per year

Your model today captures the same logic these professionals use every day:
conditions in → decomposer activity → what gets recycled and what doesn't.
The chain you built is at the heart of soil science.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: Nature's Recycling System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson makes decomposition viscerally real by starting with a
surprising, slightly funny question: why doesn't Earth fill up with
dead stuff? Students model the conditions that drive decomposer
activity and discover how matter cycles through ecosystems. The
lesson builds scientific modeling skills while anchoring the
5-LS2-1 standard in an accessible, engaging phenomenon.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-LS2-1: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among
plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: bring in a handful of compost or dark soil to show
□ Review vocabulary: decomposer, nutrient, organic matter, moisture

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Decomposers only work on dead animals" → Decomposers break down
  ALL organic material: leaves, wood, food waste, dead plants
• "Dirt is just dirt" → Healthy soil is a living ecosystem with
  billions of organisms per teaspoon
• "Decomposition only happens underground" → Decomposers are also in
  water, on surfaces, even inside other organisms

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Ask students "When was the last time you saw a pile of
  dead leaves still there years later?" This prompts them to recognize
  that dead matter disappears — creating the authentic question.
• Activity 2: Use the analogy of an assembly line — dead matter is
  the raw material, moisture is the power, decomposers are the workers,
  nutrients are the finished product.
• Activity 3: The drought scenario is the key insight moment. Let
  students observe the accumulation of dead matter silently before
  asking what they notice.
• Activity 4: If students ask about plastic not decomposing, validate
  it — that's a real and important extension connecting to the pollution unit.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "Why do tropical rainforests have almost no dead leaves on the ground?"
• "What would happen to plant life if all decomposers disappeared overnight?"
• "How is your backyard compost bin a controlled version of this model?"
• "If climate change warms the soil, how might that affect the recycling system?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Human impact unit → Decomposers can't break down plastic; landfills accumulate
• Water cycle → Moisture drives decomposition rates; drought slows recycling
• Soil health and food production → Nutrients from decomposition feed crops

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student explain the cause-effect chain from dead matter to nutrient release?
• Does student correctly identify all positive relationships in the model?
• Did student identify a meaningful gap in the model and add a researched component?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide sentence frames — "When __ goes up, __ goes __ because..."
Challenge: Add temperature and earthworms; calculate decomposition rate changes
ELL: Provide bilingual vocabulary cards; use the visual graph for explanation

• Nutrient Release: went UP / went DOWN / stayed same
• Dead Organic Matter: went UP / went DOWN / stayed same

When I brought Soil Moisture BACK, this happened:
• Decomposer Activity: went UP / went DOWN / stayed same

The ecosystem needs BOTH of these things to recycle matter:
