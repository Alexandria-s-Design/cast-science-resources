### Title
**When Trees Become Matches — California's Burning Season and the Earth Systems That Fuel It**

### Overview
Students model why California experiences devastating wildfires year after year. By building a simple cause-and-effect model of drought, dry vegetation, and fire spread, students discover how Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere interact to create "perfect fire conditions." This lesson serves as a hook for deeper inquiry into climate, weather patterns, and human impacts on natural systems.

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-ESS2-1**: Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.

### Learning Objectives
- Model how lack of rainfall affects vegetation
- Trace cause-and-effect relationships between drought and fire conditions
- Explain how Earth systems (atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere) interact
- Predict what happens when one part of the system changes

### Component List (Starting Model: 3-4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Rainfall | External | Precipitation from atmosphere (students can't control weather) |
| Dry Vegetation | Internal | Plants and trees that become fuel |
| Fire Spread | Internal | How fast and far fire moves |
| Wind | External | Air movement that spreads flames |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Fire System

### Text Editor

```
WHEN TREES BECOME MATCHES

California burns every single year. The Golden State turns orange with smoke
and flames. But why? It's not bad luck — it's science. And you're about to
model exactly why it happens.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Rainfall" — weather controls this, not us
  ○ Click "Wind" — nature decides when it blows
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Dry Vegetation" — this changes based on conditions
  ○ Click "Fire Spread" — this is what we're trying to understand

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (weather, wind)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of California's fire system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"Every year, same story. California's on fire again. News helicopters,
evacuations, orange skies you can see from space. But here's the thing —
this isn't random. This isn't bad luck. This is Earth systems doing
exactly what Earth systems do.

Today, you're going to model WHY California burns. Not just watch it
happen, but understand the invisible chain of events that turns trees
into matches.

Let's build our fire system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things we can't control.
Weather. Wind. Nature does what nature does.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system.

Click on 'Rainfall' — that's external. We can't make it rain.
Click on 'Wind' — also external. Can't control that either.
Now click 'Dry Vegetation' — internal. This CHANGES based on conditions.
Finally, 'Fire Spread' — internal. This is what we're trying to understand.

But first, you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things we
can't control? Which ones are internal — things that change because of
other things in the system?

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one to your
model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there, not
connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible lines that
turn California gold into California orange.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those four components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Rainfall" and drag an arrow to "Dry Vegetation"
• Click on "Dry Vegetation" and drag an arrow to "Fire Spread"
• Click on "Wind" and drag an arrow to "Fire Spread"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/- toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Rainfall → Dry Vegetation = NEGATIVE (−)
    More rain = LESS dry vegetation (plants are wet!)

  ○ Dry Vegetation → Fire Spread = POSITIVE (+)
    More dry plants = MORE fire spread (more fuel!)

  ○ Wind → Fire Spread = POSITIVE (+)
    More wind = MORE fire spread (flames jump further!)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship, 2 positive relationships
• This is your fire system!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Notice something? Rainfall is the KEY. When rain stops, everything
else falls like dominoes toward fire.
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each other yet.
Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships that make this a
SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Rainfall' and drag an arrow over to
'Dry Vegetation.' These two are connected. But HOW are they connected?

Here's the key question: When rainfall goes UP, does dry vegetation
go UP or DOWN?

Think about it... more rain means plants are WET, not dry. So this is
a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other goes DOWN.

Click the minus sign in the top left to make this a negative connection.

Next: Connect 'Dry Vegetation' to 'Fire Spread.' When there's MORE
dry vegetation, is there MORE or LESS fire spread?

More fuel means more fire! That's a POSITIVE relationship. Both go
up together. Click the plus sign.

Last one: Connect 'Wind' to 'Fire Spread.' More wind, more fire
spread — embers fly further, flames jump roads. Another POSITIVE.

Look at your model now. You've got one negative relationship and
two positive ones. And notice where everything leads? Fire Spread is
the END of the chain. Everything flows toward it.

But here's the real insight — look at Rainfall. It's the FIRST domino.
When rain stops, vegetation dries out. When vegetation dries out,
fire spreads easier. When wind kicks up? Disaster.

You just mapped the chain of events that burns California every year.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Fire Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Rainfall is HIGH (100%), what happens to Dry Vegetation?
• When Dry Vegetation is LOW, what happens to Fire Spread?

STEP 3: CREATE A DROUGHT
• Look at the RIGHT PANEL where your components are listed
• Find the LOCK icon (🔒) next to "Rainfall"
• Click the lock to TURN OFF Rainfall (set to 0%)
• This simulates a drought — no rain for months

STEP 4: WATCH THE CASCADE
• Resume the simulation
• What happens to Dry Vegetation when rain stops?
• What happens to Fire Spread when vegetation dries out?

STEP 5: ADD WIND
• Lock "Wind" to ON (100%)
• This simulates California's famous hot, dry Santa Ana winds
• What happens to Fire Spread now?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• What combination creates the WORST fire conditions?
• What would need to change to REDUCE fire risk?
• Does your model match what you see on the news every fall?
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if California burns in your model like it
burns in real life.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. When Rainfall is high — sitting at 100% — watch what
happens to Dry Vegetation. It stays LOW. The negative relationship
is working. Rain keeps plants wet.

And when Dry Vegetation is low? Fire Spread stays low too. No fuel,
no fire. Makes sense, right?

Now let's create a drought. Look at the right panel where your
components are listed. See the little lock icon next to Rainfall?
Click it. Set Rainfall to zero percent.

This is what happens every summer in California. Months without rain.

Resume the simulation. Watch Dry Vegetation start CLIMBING. Without
rain, plants dry out. They become fuel. And as that line rises...

Watch Fire Spread. It's rising too! The dominoes are falling exactly
like we predicted.

Now here's where it gets scary. Lock 'Wind' to 100%. These are the
Santa Ana winds — hot, dry gusts that blow every fall in California.

Look at Fire Spread now. It's maxed out. Perfect fire conditions.

This is your model EXPLAINING why California burns at the same time
every single year. Late summer, no rain for months, dry vegetation
everywhere, then the winds kick up and...

You just simulated wildfire season.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a simple fire system. It explains the basics. But real
California wildfires involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a TV news reporter
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF wind but keep drought going?
   • What happens if rainfall comes back? How fast do things change?
   • Can you find a combination where fire spread stays LOW?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real fires involve more. Think about:

   • Temperature/Heat Waves — how might this connect?
   • Humans — campfires, power lines, arson... where do people fit?
   • Firefighters — how would you model something that REDUCES fire?
   • Terrain/Mountains — fires move differently uphill vs. downhill
   • Climate Change — what if droughts get longer every decade?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • How do Earth's spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere) interact?
   • What is the water cycle and how does it connect to weather patterns?
   • How do humans impact natural systems?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does California have a "fire season" but other states don't?
   • What are the Santa Ana winds and where do they come from?
   • How has fire season changed in the last 50 years?
   • What role do dead trees from beetle infestations play?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your fire model works. Drought leads to dry vegetation leads to
fire spread — especially when wind kicks in. But you and I both
know this isn't the whole story.

Real wildfires are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're a
news reporter. Explain what's happening and WHY to someone next
to you. If you can explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. What happens if you turn wind OFF but
keep the drought going? What if rain comes back? How fast does
your system recover? Play with the locks and see what you discover.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has four components. Real California fires involve way
more. Think about...

Temperature. Heat waves. When it's 110 degrees, does that affect
fire spread? How would you model that?

Humans. Eighty-five percent of wildfires are started by people.
Campfires, power lines, even car sparks. Where do PEOPLE fit in
your model?

Firefighters. They FIGHT fire. That's a NEGATIVE relationship to
fire spread. How would you add that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's always
getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

🔥 CAREER CONNECTION: WILDFIRE DATA SCIENTIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Wildfire Data Scientists build computer models just like the one
you made today — except theirs predict where fires will start
BEFORE they happen. They analyze weather data, vegetation maps,
wind patterns, and climate trends to warn communities and position
firefighters in advance.

Companies like Google, insurance firms, and government agencies
hire these scientists to protect people and property.

💰 SALARY: $95,000 - $150,000+ per year

These scientists literally save lives by understanding the same
cause-and-effect chains you just modeled. Your simple fire model?
That's step one toward this career.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: When Trees Become Matches
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson serves as a HOOK for Earth systems inquiry. Students
build a simple cause-and-effect model, then identify gaps that
drive further research. It's designed to drop into existing
curriculum with minimal prep.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-ESS2-1: Develop a model using an example to describe ways the
geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Have recent wildfire news images ready (optional hook)
□ Review vocabulary: drought, vegetation, atmosphere, biosphere

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Fires are caused by bad people" → Most are human-caused, but
   conditions must be right. Without dry fuel, fires don't spread.
• "More firefighters = no fires" → Firefighters respond, but
   conditions (drought, wind) determine severity.
• "Climate doesn't affect fires" → Fire season has lengthened
   significantly due to climate patterns.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
   guide positive/negative relationship decisions.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
   things on/off and observe. This is where insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. "What about heat?"
   "Where do humans fit?" Let curiosity drive.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "Why does California burn at the same time every year?"
• "What would need to change to prevent these fires?"
• "How is this connected to what we learned about the water cycle?"
• "If you were a firefighter, where would you want to be positioned
   BEFORE fire season starts?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Water cycle unit → Drought as part of larger pattern
• Human impact → Adding humans/power lines to model
• Climate change → Researching how fire season has changed

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student explain the cause-effect chain verbally?
• Does student's model show correct positive/negative relationships?
• Did student add at least one researched component?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Pre-label relationships; use sentence starters for explanation
Challenge: Add 3+ components; calculate actual fire risk percentages
ELL: Provide visual vocabulary cards; pair with English-proficient partner
