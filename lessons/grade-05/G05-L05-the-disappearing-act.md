### Title
**The Disappearing Act — Ice Melts, But the Mass Never Leaves**

### Overview
Students model the apparent "disappearing act" when ice melts — discovering that the mass doesn't vanish, it just changes form. By building a cause-and-effect model showing how temperature shifts matter between solid and liquid states while keeping total mass constant, students internalize the law of conservation of matter. The puzzle hook ("where did it go?") drives curiosity and the model provides the satisfying answer through simulation.

### Cover Image

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-PS1-2**: Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change that occurs when heating, cooling, or mixing substances, the total weight of matter is conserved.

### Learning Objectives
- Observe and explain why the total mass of a substance doesn't change when it changes state
- Model how temperature shifts matter between solid and liquid form
- Predict what happens to each state of matter as temperature changes
- Apply conservation of matter to explain everyday physical changes

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Air Temperature | External | The warmth or cold of the environment — students can't control weather |
| Starting Mass | External | The total amount of matter (stays constant — the key insight!) |
| Ice Amount | Internal | How much of the substance is in solid form |
| Liquid Water Amount | Internal | How much of the substance is in liquid form |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Matter-Changing System

THE DISAPPEARING ACT

Here's a magic trick. Put an ice cube on a scale. It weighs 50 grams.
Come back an hour later. The ice is GONE. Just a puddle of water.

Now here's the question: how much does the water weigh?

If you guessed "less than 50 grams because some of it disappeared"
— you're not alone. Most people guess that.

The answer? Still exactly 50 grams. Every single time.

Where did the ice go? It didn't go anywhere. It just... changed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Air Temperature" — the environment decides how warm it is
  ○ Click "Starting Mass" — this is the TOTAL matter (it never changes!)
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Ice Amount" — changes based on temperature
  ○ Click "Liquid Water Amount" — changes based on temperature

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• What do students control? What changes on its own?
• Your teacher will explain the key relationship in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The ice cube "disappears" into liquid water. But the mass never goes
anywhere. Your model is going to show exactly where it goes.
```

### Video Script

```
"Imagine you put an ice cube on a scale. It weighs exactly 50 grams.
You go have lunch. You come back an hour later.

The ice is gone. Just water in the dish.

How much does the water weigh?

Here's what most people think: less than 50 grams. Something evaporated.
Something disappeared. It LOOKS like less water than ice, right?

Wrong.

The water weighs exactly 50 grams. Every. Single. Time. The matter
doesn't disappear — it changes FORM.

This is one of the most fundamental laws in science: the law of
conservation of matter. Matter cannot be created or destroyed. It
can only change form.

Today you're going to model this apparent magic trick and prove to
yourself why it's not magic at all — it's physics.

Look at your component panel.

Air Temperature — external. The environment controls how warm it is.

Starting Mass — also external. And here's the key: Starting Mass
NEVER CHANGES in your model. It represents the total amount of
matter. Matter is conserved. Always.

Ice Amount — internal. This changes based on temperature. More cold
= more ice. More heat = less ice.

Liquid Water Amount — internal. Also changes with temperature.
More heat = more liquid. More cold = less liquid.

Sort your components. Add them to your canvas.

The disappearing act is about to be explained.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the State-Change System

### Text Editor

```
THE INVISIBLE TRANSFER

When temperature changes, ice and liquid water trade places.
But the total never changes. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Air Temperature → Ice Amount
• Air Temperature → Liquid Water Amount
• Ice Amount → Liquid Water Amount

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
  ○ Air Temperature → Ice Amount = NEGATIVE (−)
    More heat = LESS ice (it melts away)

  ○ Air Temperature → Liquid Water Amount = POSITIVE (+)
    More heat = MORE liquid water (from melting)

  ○ Ice Amount → Liquid Water Amount = NEGATIVE (−)
    More ice = LESS liquid water
    (They're the SAME matter in two different forms — when one goes up,
    the other MUST go down)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows: 2 negative, 1 positive
• Look carefully at Ice → Liquid: this is the CONSERVATION relationship!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

KEY INSIGHT: Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount are connected by a
NEGATIVE relationship — not because they fight each other, but because
they're the SAME matter in two different forms. They always add up to
the same Starting Mass.
```

### Video Script

```
"Your components are sorted. Now let's map the relationships that
explain the disappearing act.

Click the Connect icon.

First connection: Air Temperature to Ice Amount. When temperature
goes UP — when it gets warmer — does ice amount go UP or DOWN?

Ice melts when it gets warm. More temperature = LESS ice.
That's NEGATIVE. Click the minus sign.

Second: Air Temperature to Liquid Water Amount. When temperature
goes up, what happens to liquid water?

Ice melts INTO liquid water. More warmth = MORE liquid.
That's POSITIVE. Click the plus sign.

Third — and this is the most important one: Ice Amount to Liquid
Water Amount.

Think carefully. When there's MORE ice, is there MORE or LESS
liquid water?

Less! Because ice and liquid water are the SAME substance — just
in different forms. They're sharing the same mass. When ice amount
goes up, liquid water amount goes DOWN, because it's the same matter.

That's NEGATIVE. Click the minus sign.

Here's what your model just captured: Ice and liquid water are
connected by a negative relationship because they ARE the same
stuff. When one form increases, the other decreases. Together,
they always equal the Starting Mass.

That's conservation of matter. That's the law.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the State-Change Model

### Text Editor

```
PROVE THAT MASS IS CONSERVED

Your model connects temperature, ice, and water. Now let's run it
and verify that matter is actually conserved — that nothing disappears.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click "Play" in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines

STEP 2: OBSERVE AT NORMAL TEMPERATURE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice the relationship between Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount
• As one goes up, does the other go down?

STEP 3: SIMULATE A FREEZE
• Lock Air Temperature to LOW (10%) — freezing conditions
• Watch Ice Amount: does it go UP?
• Watch Liquid Water Amount: does it go DOWN?
• Does Starting Mass change? (It should STAY flat!)

STEP 4: SIMULATE SUMMER HEAT
• Unlock and set Air Temperature to HIGH (90%) — hot conditions
• Watch Ice Amount: does it go DOWN?
• Watch Liquid Water Amount: does it go UP?
• Is Starting Mass still the same flat line?

STEP 5: WATCH THE MIRROR
• Notice that Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount are like MIRRORS
• When one goes up, the other goes down by the SAME amount
• Starting Mass stays constant — THAT'S conservation of matter!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• Does it matter if matter is a solid or liquid — is the mass the same?
• Why does ice look like it's "disappearing" when it melts?
• Can you think of other examples where matter changes form but not mass?
```

### Video Script

```
"Let's run your model and watch conservation of matter in action.

Click Play. Watch the graph. In normal room-temperature conditions,
you'll see Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount both present — some
of the substance is frozen, some is liquid.

Now notice something: Starting Mass. It's a flat line. It doesn't
move. No matter what else changes in this model, that line stays put.

Let's test it. Lock Air Temperature to 10%. Freezing cold.

Watch Ice Amount. It's climbing — more and more is freezing.
Watch Liquid Water Amount. It's dropping — the liquid is freezing.

And Starting Mass? Still flat. The matter didn't disappear.
It just moved from liquid form to solid form.

The total weight of your substance never changed.

Now let's do summer. Unlock temperature and lock it to 90%. Hot.

Ice Amount drops rapidly — it's all melting.
Liquid Water Amount climbs — the ice is becoming water.

And Starting Mass? Flat. Still the same. Always the same.

THIS is why your ice cube still weighs 50 grams when it melts.
The matter didn't go anywhere. It changed what it LOOKS LIKE.
Solid to liquid. Same mass. Always.

The magic trick isn't magic. It's conservation of matter.

Look at your model: Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount are perfect
mirrors of each other. They trade mass between them. But the total?
Never changes.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

CONSERVATION EVERYWHERE

You proved it with ice and water. But conservation of matter applies
to EVERY physical and chemical change. The law doesn't take days off.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. FIND THE TIPPING POINT
   • At what temperature does Ice Amount go to zero?
   • At what temperature does Liquid Water Amount go to zero?
   • Is there a temperature where both are equal?

2. THE EVAPORATION MYSTERY
   • What if we add even more heat? Some liquid water becomes water VAPOR (gas)
   • Does the mass disappear when water evaporates? (No! It just becomes invisible gas)
   • Where would "Water Vapor Amount" fit in your model?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model shows solid ↔ liquid. But matter has a THIRD state:

   • Gas/Water Vapor — when water evaporates, it's still matter, just invisible
   • Sublimation — dry ice skips liquid entirely and goes straight to gas
   • Chemical Changes — when wood burns, the mass becomes CO2 gas + ash (still conserved!)
   • Mixing — when salt dissolves in water, the salt is STILL THERE (same mass!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What are the three states of matter?
   • What is the law of conservation of matter?
   • What is the difference between a physical change and a chemical change?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • When you burn a log, the ash weighs less than the log. Where did the mass go?
   • Why does a wet towel weigh more than a dry one?
   • If you dissolve sugar in water and then weigh it, is the total mass the same?
   • What happens to the mass of food when you digest it?

🌐 RELIABLE SOURCES:
   • PhET Simulations (phet.colorado.edu) — states of matter simulator
   • ACS Chemistry: acs.org
   • NASA Climate Kids: climatekids.nasa.gov

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Add "Water Vapor Amount" as an Internal component
   • Connect it: Temperature → Water Vapor (+), Water Vapor → Liquid Water (−)
   • Now your model shows all THREE states of water!
   • Run the simulation — does everything still add up to Starting Mass?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model proved conservation of matter with ice and liquid water.
But here's the bigger question: does this law apply everywhere? To
every kind of change?

Yes. Always. No exceptions.

When wood burns, the ash weighs much less than the original log.
Seems like matter disappeared, right? Wrong. The 'missing' mass
became carbon dioxide gas and water vapor — it floated into the
atmosphere. If you could capture all the gas from burning, you'd
get the exact same mass as the original log.

When you digest food, the food seems to 'disappear.' But your body
uses those molecules for energy, releases some as CO2 when you
breathe, and uses the rest to rebuild your cells. Nothing disappears.
It all goes somewhere.

This is why conservation of matter is called a LAW. Not a suggestion.
Not a guideline. A law. Matter doesn't appear or disappear. It changes form.

Here's your extension challenge: what happens to water BEYOND melting?

Water vapor. When liquid water gets hot enough, it evaporates —
becomes an invisible gas. Is the mass still there?

Yes! Water vapor is still H2O molecules. They're just moving too
fast to see. The mass is in the air.

Add 'Water Vapor Amount' to your model. When temperature is very
high, liquid water should decrease AND ice should be zero — because
it's all becoming vapor.

Connect the relationships. Run the simulation. Does everything
still add up to Starting Mass?

You've now modeled all three states of matter — solid, liquid, gas —
all following the same law. The law of conservation of matter is
one of the most powerful ideas in all of science.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔬 CAREER CONNECTION: FORENSIC CHEMIST / MATERIALS SCIENTIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Forensic Chemists use conservation of matter to solve crimes. When
a substance changes form at a crime scene — a liquid evaporates, a
solid dissolves, something burns — forensic chemists can reconstruct
exactly what was there before. They track matter through state changes
and chemical reactions, using the fact that mass is always conserved
to trace what happened.

Materials Scientists use the same principles to design new substances.
They need to know how materials behave when they change phase —
from solid to liquid to gas — to engineer everything from spacecraft
heat shields to medicine delivery systems. Understanding state changes
at the particle level is what allows them to create materials that
behave in specific ways under specific conditions.

💰 SALARY: $65,000 - $100,000 per year

The conservation principle you modeled today — that matter changes
form but never disappears — is the foundation of chemistry, forensics,
and materials science. You practiced real scientific thinking today.

TEACHER GUIDE: The Disappearing Act
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson uses the mystery of a melting ice cube to make conservation
of matter personal and testable. By building a model where Starting Mass
never changes while Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount trade off, students
see the law of conservation demonstrated visually in a simulation. The
"magic trick" framing creates genuine curiosity before the explanation.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-PS1-2: Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless
of the type of change that occurs when heating, cooling, or mixing
substances, the total weight of matter is conserved.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: bring a scale, ice cube, and container — do the demo live!
□ Review vocabulary: conservation, states of matter, physical change

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Ice weighs more than water because it's solid" → Same mass, different density
• "Matter disappears when it evaporates" → Water vapor is still matter;
  it just becomes invisible gas molecules
• "Burning destroys matter" → Combustion converts solid mass into gases
  (CO2, H2O vapor) — mass is still conserved

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: If possible, actually put an ice cube on a scale at the start
  and let students predict what the mass will be after melting. The live
  demo is powerful.
• Activity 2: Emphasize that the negative Ice → Liquid relationship exists
  because they're sharing the same mass, not because they're opponents.
• Activity 3: Point to the flat Starting Mass line as the "proof" —
  ask students what it would mean if that line moved.
• Activity 4: The burning log example is a common confusion point —
  address it directly. Where does the "missing" mass go?

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "If you weigh yourself before and after breathing out, are you lighter?"
• "When food digests, where does the mass of the food go?"
• "Does the mass of a candle change as it burns? Where does it go?"
• "If you dissolve sugar in water and drink it, is the sugar 'gone'?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Chemical reactions unit → Conservation applies to chemical changes too
• Water cycle → Evaporation conserves mass but moves it to atmosphere
• Human body → Digestion and metabolism as matter transformation

ASSESSMENT:
• Does student correctly identify the negative relationship between
  Ice Amount and Liquid Water Amount?
• Can student explain why Starting Mass stays flat in the simulation?
• Did student apply conservation of matter to a second example beyond ice?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Pre-labeled "before and after" diagram showing mass staying constant
Challenge: Calculate the mass of CO2 released when burning a known mass of wood
ELL: Use visual diagrams with labels in home language; physical demo helps
