### Title
**Where Does a Tree's Mass Come From? — A 1-Ton Tree Got Most of Its Weight From Air**

### Overview
Students model one of the most mind-blowing facts in science: a massive tree gets most of its mass from the air, not from the soil. By building a cause-and-effect model showing how CO2 from the atmosphere and sunlight drive photosynthesis, which in turn builds a tree's physical mass, students directly observe the 5-LS1-1 standard in action. The counter-intuitive phenomenon — air becoming solid wood — creates immediate wonder and drives the investigation.

### Cover Image

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-LS1-1**: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain that plants get most of their mass from carbon dioxide in the air, not soil
- Model how CO2 and sunlight drive photosynthesis
- Trace how photosynthesis converts air into the physical mass of a tree
- Predict what happens to tree growth when CO2 or sunlight is removed

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| CO2 in Air | External | Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere — plants pull this in through tiny pores |
| Sunlight | External | Solar energy available for photosynthesis — plants can't grow without it |
| Photosynthesis Rate | Internal | How fast the plant is converting CO2 + water + sunlight into sugar molecules |
| Tree Biomass | Internal | The actual physical mass of the tree — what you'd weigh if you put it on a scale |

## Activity 1: LOCATE — Build Your Tree-Building System

WHERE DOES A TREE'S MASS COME FROM?

A giant sequoia can weigh more than 1 million pounds.

Here's the question that should mess with your head:
Where did all that weight COME FROM?

The obvious answer: from the soil. A tree grows out of the ground,
so it must be pulling up stuff from the soil, right?

Except... the soil barely loses any mass when a tree grows in it.
Scientists have measured this. A tree can grow in a pot of soil
for years and the soil barely changes weight.

So where does a million-pound tree come from?

The air. Most of it — up to 95% — literally came from the air.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things the tree can't control):
  ○ Click "CO2 in Air" — carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere
  ○ Click "Sunlight" — the energy source for the whole process
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Photosynthesis Rate" — how fast the tree is converting CO2 to mass
  ○ Click "Tree Biomass" — the actual physical weight of the tree

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• EXTERNAL = inputs the tree receives from the environment
• INTERNAL = what changes inside the tree because of those inputs
• Sort them, then your teacher will explain the connections

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Air. A trillion pounds of trees on Earth, almost all made from air.
Let's model exactly how that works.
```

### Video Script

```
"Here's a question that sounds simple but will actually break your
brain: where does a tree's mass come from?

A giant sequoia — one of the biggest trees on Earth — can weigh
more than 1 million pounds. Where did all that wood, all that bark,
all that mass come from?

If you said soil, you're in good company. That's what most people
think. Trees grow in dirt. Seems logical.

But here's the experiment that changed everything: in the 1640s,
a scientist named Jan Baptist van Helmont grew a willow tree for
five years in a pot of soil. He weighed the soil at the start.
He weighed it at the end.

The tree gained 164 pounds. The soil lost... 2 ounces.

Two ounces. Not pounds. Ounces.

So where did the 164 pounds come from?

The air.

Carbon dioxide. Invisible gas floating around you right now.
Plants pull it in through tiny pores in their leaves. They combine
it with water and sunlight. And through photosynthesis, they
convert that invisible gas into solid wood, bark, and leaves.

The molecules in the air BECOME the tree.

Let's model this. Look at your component panel.

CO2 in Air — external. The atmosphere controls carbon dioxide levels.

Sunlight — also external. The tree can't make its own sunlight.

Photosynthesis Rate — internal. This is the process that converts
CO2 into tree mass. It responds to how much CO2 and sunlight are available.

Tree Biomass — internal. This is the actual physical weight of the tree.
It grows based on how fast photosynthesis is happening.

Sort your components. Add them to your canvas.

Air becoming a tree. Let's model the chemistry of that miracle.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Wire the Tree-Building Process

### Text Editor

```
HOW AIR BECOMES WOOD

CO2 goes into a leaf. Sugar comes out. Sugar becomes wood. Wood
becomes a tree. Let's map the chain.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• CO2 in Air → Photosynthesis Rate
• Sunlight → Photosynthesis Rate
• Photosynthesis Rate → Tree Biomass

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
  ○ CO2 in Air → Photosynthesis Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More CO2 available = FASTER photosynthesis
    (CO2 is literally the raw material — like flour for bread)

  ○ Sunlight → Photosynthesis Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More sunlight = MORE energy to drive the reaction
    (Photosynthesis needs light energy to combine CO2 and water)

  ○ Photosynthesis Rate → Tree Biomass = POSITIVE (+)
    Faster photosynthesis = MORE sugar produced = MORE growth
    (Every molecule of sugar made is potential wood and mass)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows, all positive
• The chain: Air + Light → Photosynthesis → Tree Mass

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Three all-positive relationships. But ask yourself: what happens if
you remove the CO2? Or the sunlight? Follow the chain.
```

### Video Script

```
"Time to wire the process that turns air into wood.

Click the Connect icon.

First connection: CO2 in Air to Photosynthesis Rate.

Here's the chemistry: CO2 is the raw material of photosynthesis.
When a plant does photosynthesis, it pulls CO2 out of the air and
uses the carbon atoms to build sugar molecules. More CO2 available
means more raw material — means faster production.

More CO2 = faster photosynthesis. POSITIVE. Click the plus.

Second: Sunlight to Photosynthesis Rate.

Sunlight is the energy source that powers the whole reaction.
Without light, the process can't run — like a factory without
electricity. More light = more power = faster processing.

More sunlight = faster photosynthesis. POSITIVE again.

Third: Photosynthesis Rate to Tree Biomass.

This is the payoff. Every photosynthesis reaction produces glucose —
sugar. The plant uses that sugar to build new cells, new wood, new
bark, new leaves. The faster photosynthesis runs, the faster the
tree grows and adds mass.

More photosynthesis = more tree mass. Positive.

Three arrows. All positive. The chain is complete: CO2 from air +
sunlight → photosynthesis → tree mass.

Now here's what I want you to sit with: when you look at a tree —
any tree — you're looking at air that became solid. Carbon dioxide
molecules that were once floating in the atmosphere, now locked into
wood that might stand for a thousand years.

The air literally became the tree.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Tree-Growth Model

### Text Editor

```
WATCH AIR BECOME A TREE

Your model connects CO2 and sunlight through photosynthesis to
tree mass. Let's run it and see how these inputs control tree growth.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click "Play" in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines

STEP 2: OBSERVE NORMAL GROWING CONDITIONS
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• With CO2 and Sunlight at normal levels, how fast does Tree Biomass grow?

STEP 3: REMOVE THE CO2
• Lock CO2 in Air to 0%
• This simulates a sealed environment — no carbon dioxide
• What happens to Photosynthesis Rate?
• What happens to Tree Biomass growth?
• Does Tree Biomass reverse, or just stop growing?

STEP 4: RESTORE CO2, THEN REMOVE SUNLIGHT
• Unlock CO2. Lock Sunlight to 0%
• This simulates a cave or completely shaded environment
• What happens now?

STEP 5: MAXIMUM GROWTH CONDITIONS
• Unlock both. Set CO2 to HIGH and Sunlight to HIGH
• Greenhouses do exactly this — extra CO2 + bright lights = faster plant growth
• Watch how fast Tree Biomass climbs!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• If CO2 makes plants grow faster, why is more CO2 in the atmosphere
  due to climate change still a problem?
• Why can't a tree grow in a windowless room?
• What would happen to a forest if the sun was blocked for a year?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your tree-building model is live. Let's grow some trees.

Click Play. With CO2 and sunlight both at normal levels, watch
Photosynthesis Rate. It's running. And watch Tree Biomass — it's
slowly climbing. The tree is growing. Air is becoming wood.

Now let's run the experiment that would kill any plant on Earth.

Lock CO2 to zero. No carbon dioxide. Plants survive in regular air,
but let's see what the model predicts with none at all.

Watch Photosynthesis Rate drop. The raw material is gone — the
factory shuts down. No CO2 = no photosynthesis.

And Tree Biomass? It stops growing. The tree can't add any more
mass because it can't get the carbon it needs.

Now restore CO2 and remove sunlight instead.

Same result. Photosynthesis needs BOTH the raw material (CO2) AND
the energy source (sunlight). Remove either one, and the process
stops. Tree Biomass stops growing.

This is why forest floors are shaded — trees compete intensely for
sunlight. The tallest trees win the light. Shorter trees fall behind.

Now here's the interesting part: real greenhouse growers actually
INJECT extra CO2 into their greenhouses. They know that more CO2
plus more light equals faster growth. Set both to max.

Watch Tree Biomass climb. Faster than before. This is real
greenhouse agriculture — accelerating photosynthesis to grow
more food faster.

Your model just explained something that professional farmers and
climate scientists both study: CO2 is the building block of plant
mass. Every tree on Earth is made of air.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
THE BIGGER PICTURE: WHAT TREES DO FOR US

A tree is made of air. That means every molecule of CO2 a tree
absorbs is carbon removed from the atmosphere. Trees are carbon
storage devices. Giant, living CO2 sponges.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. WHAT'S THE FASTEST GROWTH?
   • Find the combination of CO2 and Sunlight that grows Tree Biomass fastest
   • Is there a maximum? Does more CO2 always mean more growth?

2. WHAT LIMITS GROWTH?
   • Trees also need water (not modeled yet). What happens in a drought?
   • Trees need nutrients from soil (minerals, not mass). Why is there a difference?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model explains mass but misses other key factors:

   • Water — photosynthesis also requires water (H2O) as a raw material
   • Nutrients — soil provides nitrogen, phosphorus, minerals (essential but not mass)
   • Temperature — too hot or cold and photosynthesis slows dramatically
   • Root System — larger roots access more water and anchor bigger trees
   • Deforestation — when trees are cut, all that stored CO2 is released back

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What is photosynthesis? Write the chemical equation.
   • What do plants get from soil if not their mass?
   • How are plants different from animals in how they get energy?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How much CO2 does one tree absorb in a year?
   • Why is deforestation a climate problem? (Hint: stored carbon)
   • What is the Amazon rainforest called "the lungs of the Earth"?
   • How do carnivorous plants like Venus flytraps get nutrients without normal soil?

   • NASA Climate Kids: climatekids.nasa.gov
   • National Geographic: nationalgeographic.org

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Water is a great addition — it's External, and it feeds into Photosynthesis Rate (+)
   • Or add Temperature — it affects Photosynthesis Rate but not always positively
   • Run your new model. Does it tell a more complete story?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model explains how CO2 from the air and sunlight combine
through photosynthesis to build tree mass. Air becomes wood.

But here's where this gets really important.

If trees are made of CO2 pulled from the atmosphere, then a forest
is basically a carbon storage vault. Every tree is holding carbon
that used to be floating in the air as greenhouse gas.

When we cut down forests — deforestation — we're not just losing
trees. We're releasing all that stored carbon back into the atmosphere.
The Amazon rainforest alone holds about 90 billion tons of carbon.
That's why protecting it matters so much.

And here's the flip side: planting trees is one way to pull CO2
back out of the atmosphere. Trees are literal air-cleaning machines.

Now let's expand your model.

Your current model is missing water. But photosynthesis actually
requires three things: CO2, sunlight, and WATER. The chemical equation
for photosynthesis is:

6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2

Six carbon dioxide molecules, six water molecules, light energy —
they combine to make one glucose sugar and six oxygen molecules.
The oxygen? That's what you're breathing right now.

Add Water as an External component. Connect it to Photosynthesis Rate
with a positive relationship — more water = more photosynthesis.

Run your new model. What happens during a drought? Does tree growth
slow even if CO2 and sunlight are plentiful?

That's what's happening right now in forests experiencing climate
change — warming temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are
stressing photosynthesis even when CO2 is high.

What does YOUR expanded tree model reveal?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌳 CAREER CONNECTION: PLANT BIOLOGIST / AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Plant Biologists study photosynthesis, plant growth, and how plants
respond to changing environments. They're working on some of the
most important problems of our time: How do we grow more food with
less water? How do we breed crops that can survive drought and heat?
How can we maximize how much CO2 forests absorb to fight climate change?

Agricultural Scientists apply plant biology to the farm — developing
new crop varieties, optimizing greenhouse conditions (extra CO2!
Grow lights!), and creating farming practices that produce more food
while protecting the environment.

💰 SALARY: $65,000 - $105,000 per year

The model you built today — CO2 + sunlight → photosynthesis → plant mass —
is literally the foundation of all of agriculture. Feed 8 billion people?
You do it by maximizing photosynthesis. Your model is where it starts.

TEACHER GUIDE: Where Does a Tree's Mass Come From?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson addresses and corrects one of the most persistent
misconceptions in science education — that plants get their mass
from soil. Van Helmont's experiment (1648) is used as a historical
hook, and the model allows students to prove to themselves that
CO2 drives plant mass, not soil. The climate change connection in
Activity 4 makes the science immediately relevant.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they
need for growth chiefly from air and water.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: bring a small potted plant and bag of soil to demonstrate
  Van Helmont's experiment concept
□ Review vocabulary: photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, biomass, chlorophyll

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Plants get their mass from soil" → Soil provides minerals and water,
  but mass comes from CO2 pulled from the air
• "Trees take in oxygen" → Trees produce oxygen; they take in CO2
• "Plants don't need sunlight, just water and soil" → Sunlight is
  essential — it's the energy source for photosynthesis

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Start with the question "Where does a tree's mass come from?"
  and take a class vote. Record predictions to revisit after the lesson.
• Activity 2: The photosynthesis equation (6CO2 + 6H2O + light → glucose + O2)
  can be introduced here even if students don't need to memorize it — it
  makes the "ingredients" visible.
• Activity 3: The CO2 removal scenario is the key insight moment. When
  Tree Biomass stops growing, students physically see the connection.
• Activity 4: Connect to climate change — deforestation releases stored
  CO2 back to atmosphere. This gives students environmental context.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "If you weigh a seed, plant it, and weigh the full-grown tree,
  where did all the extra mass come from?"
• "Why is deforestation a climate issue? (Think about where the mass went.)"
• "If CO2 in the atmosphere is rising, does that mean plants should
  be growing faster? (Yes, but other factors limit this.)"
• "Why can't plants grow in completely dark environments like caves?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Climate change → Forests as carbon sinks; deforestation releasing stored carbon
• Water cycle → Water is also a raw material of photosynthesis
• Matter cycling → Photosynthesis is the entry point of carbon into food chains

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student correctly state that plants get mass primarily from CO2?
• Does student's model show CO2 and sunlight as both positive drivers of growth?
• Did student observe that removing CO2 stops tree mass accumulation?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide the photosynthesis equation written out in words; pre-label model diagram
Challenge: Calculate how much CO2 a forest absorbs per year; model deforestation
ELL: Use multilingual labels on the component diagram; Van Helmont experiment visual is universal
