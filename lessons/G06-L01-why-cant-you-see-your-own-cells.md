### Title
**Why Can't You See Your Own Cells? — Exploring the Microscopic Building Blocks of Life**

### Overview
Cells are the fundamental units of life — every living organism on Earth is made of one or more cells. Understanding cell structure and function is the foundation of all biology and medicine. Students investigate the driving question: If your body is made of 37 trillion cells, why can't you see a single one? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
6th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-LS1-1, MS-LS1-2**: Conduct an investigation to provide evidence that living things are made of cells; either one cell or many different numbers and types of cells. Develop and use a model to describe the function of a cell as a whole and ways the parts of cells contribute to the function.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain why cells are too small to see without magnification
- Model how cell size, nutrient supply, and oxygen level affect cell function
- Describe how waste buildup limits cell growth and survival
- Compare how single-celled and multi-celled organisms organize their cells

### Component List (Starting Model: 3-4 Components)

WHY CAN'T YOU SEE YOUR OWN CELLS?

Exploring the Microscopic Building Blocks of Life.
If your body is made of 37 trillion cells, why can't you see a single one?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Nutrient Supply" — the amount of food and energy molecules available to cells from the environment
  ○ Click "Oxygen Level" — the concentration of oxygen reaching cells for cellular respiration
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Cell Size" — the physical dimensions of a cell — smaller cells exchange materials more efficiently
  ○ Click "Waste Buildup" — the accumulation of metabolic waste products inside and around cells

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"If your body is made of 37 trillion cells, why can't you see a single one?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Cell Size' — that's internal. The physical dimensions of a cell — smaller cells exchange materials more efficiently.
Click on 'Nutrient Supply' — that's external. The amount of food and energy molecules available to cells from the environment.
Click on 'Oxygen Level' — that's external. The concentration of oxygen reaching cells for cellular respiration.
Click on 'Waste Buildup' — that's internal. The accumulation of metabolic waste products inside and around cells.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Nutrient Supply and Oxygen Level are external because they come from the environment outside the cell — the cell depends on its surroundings for these inputs. Cell Size and Waste Buildup are internal because they are properties of the cell itself that change in response to external conditions.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Nutrient Supply" and drag an arrow to "Cell Size"
• Click on "Oxygen Level" and drag an arrow to "Waste Buildup"
• Click on "Waste Buildup" and drag an arrow to "Cell Size"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Nutrient Supply → Cell Size = POSITIVE (+)
    More nutrients allow the cell to grow and maintain its structures. Without nutrients, cells shrink and stop dividing.

  ○ Oxygen Level → Waste Buildup = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher oxygen levels allow cellular respiration to work efficiently, breaking down waste. Low oxygen causes waste to accumulate.

  ○ Waste Buildup → Cell Size = NEGATIVE (−)
    As waste accumulates, it becomes toxic and damages cell structures, causing cells to shrink and eventually die.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 1 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When nutrient supply increases, what happens to cell size and waste buildup? Is the relationship positive or negative?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Nutrient Supply' and drag an arrow
over to 'Cell Size.'

Here's the key question: When nutrient supply goes UP, does
cell size go UP or DOWN?

More nutrients allow the cell to grow and maintain its structures. Without nutrients, cells shrink and stop dividing.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Oxygen Level' and drag an arrow
over to 'Waste Buildup.'

Here's the key question: When oxygen level goes UP, does
waste buildup go UP or DOWN?

Higher oxygen levels allow cellular respiration to work efficiently, breaking down waste. Low oxygen causes waste to accumulate.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Waste Buildup' and drag an arrow
over to 'Cell Size.'

Here's the key question: When waste buildup goes UP, does
cell size go UP or DOWN?

As waste accumulates, it becomes toxic and damages cell structures, causing cells to shrink and eventually die.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 1
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When nutrient supply increases, what happens to cell size and waste buildup? Is the relationship positive or negative?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"
```

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Nutrient Supply is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — HEALTHY CELL
• Moderate nutrient supply, normal oxygen
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Waste Buildup when the cell is healthy?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — STARVATION MODE
• Lock Nutrient Supply to 10%
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Cell Size when nutrients are extremely low?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — OXYGEN CRISIS
• Set Oxygen Level to 15%
• PREDICT FIRST: How does low oxygen affect Waste Buildup compared to low nutrients?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Cells must stay small because nutrients and oxygen can only diffuse a short distance
• When nutrient supply drops, cells shrink and may stop dividing entirely
• Waste buildup is toxic — cells that can't remove waste lose function and die
• The surface-area-to-volume ratio explains why cells can't grow infinitely large

THE ANSWER: Cells are microscopic because they MUST be small. A cell needs to exchange nutrients, oxygen, and waste across its membrane, and that exchange only works efficiently at tiny scales. If cells were bigger, the center would starve while waste piled up!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Healthy Cell. Moderate nutrient supply, normal oxygen.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Starvation Mode.
Lock Nutrient Supply to 10%.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Cell Size when nutrients are extremely low?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Oxygen Crisis. Set Oxygen Level to 15%.
How does low oxygen affect Waste Buildup compared to low nutrients?

Here's what our model reveals: Cells are microscopic because they MUST be small. A cell needs to exchange nutrients, oxygen, and waste across its membrane, and that exchange only works efficiently at tiny scales. If cells were bigger, the center would starve while waste piled up!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Nutrient Supply?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Oxygen Level?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Cell Division Rate — How quickly cells copy themselves to grow or repair tissue
   • Temperature — Temperature affects how fast chemical reactions happen inside cells
   • pH Level — The acidity of the cell's environment affects enzyme function

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Cell Theory — how does this connect to your model?
   • Why Cells Are Small — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why can't a single cell grow to be the size of a basketball?
   • How is a cell like a tiny factory? What are the 'machines' inside?
   • What would happen to your body if your cells couldn't get rid of waste?
   • Why do different cells in your body have different shapes and sizes?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Cell Division Rate. How quickly cells copy themselves to grow or repair tissue
How would you model that?

Temperature. Temperature affects how fast chemical reactions happen inside cells
How would you model that?

pH Level. The acidity of the cell's environment affects enzyme function
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Can't You See Your Own Cells?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Cells are the fundamental units of life — every living organism on Earth is made of one or more cells. Understanding cell structure and function is the foundation of all biology and medicine.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS1-1, MS-LS1-2: Conduct an investigation to provide evidence that living things are made of cells; either one cell or many different numbers and types of cells. Develop and use a model to describe the function of a cell as a whole and ways the parts of cells contribute to the function.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model showing how cell size, nutrients, oxygen, and waste interact to determine cell health.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function
  All living things are made up of cells, which is the smallest unit that can be said to be alive. Cells have specific structures that perform specific functions.
• Crosscutting Concept: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
  Students explore why cells must remain at microscopic scales to function — connecting size to the efficiency of material exchange.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Cell, Organelle, Cell Membrane, Microscope
□ Prepare If your body is made of 37 trillion cells, why can't you see a single one discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify cell size, nutrient supply, oxygen level, and waste buildup as key components affecting cell function.
• Establish: Students determine that nutrient supply positively affects cell function while waste buildup negatively affects it, and that oxygen is essential for energy production.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how inputs (nutrients, oxygen) and outputs (waste) determine whether a cell thrives, shrinks, or dies.
• Evaluate: Students run starvation and oxygen-crisis scenarios to observe how removing key inputs affects the entire system.
• Revise: Students add cell division rate or temperature to explore more complex interactions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Cell Theory:
  All living things are composed of cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things. All cells come from pre-existing cells. This theory, developed in the 1830s-1850s by Schleiden, Schwann, and Virchow, is one of the foundational principles of modern biology.

• Why Cells Are Small:
  Cells must exchange materials (nutrients in, waste out) across their cell membrane. As a cell grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area (cube vs. square relationship). Eventually, the membrane can't supply the interior fast enough. This surface-area-to-volume ratio is the key constraint on cell size.

• Cell Organelles:
  Key organelles include the nucleus (DNA storage and control center), mitochondria (energy production), ribosomes (protein construction), endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid processing), and cell membrane (boundary and gatekeeper). Each plays a critical role in keeping the cell alive.

• Cells in the Human Body:
  The human body contains approximately 37.2 trillion cells of about 200 different types. Red blood cells carry oxygen, white blood cells fight infection, neurons transmit signals, and muscle cells enable movement. Despite their diversity, all share the same basic cellular machinery.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Cells are just blobs of jelly"
  Reality: Cells are highly organized structures with specialized parts (organelles) that work together like a factory. Each organelle has a specific job critical to the cell's survival.
  Strategy: Show electron microscope images of real cells to reveal the complex internal structure.

• "All cells look the same"
  Reality: Human bodies have about 200 different cell types, each with a unique shape matched to its function. Red blood cells are disc-shaped for gas exchange, neurons are long for signal transmission, and muscle cells are fiber-shaped for contraction.
  Strategy: Show images of different cell types and ask students to guess their function from their shape.

• "Cells are not alive"
  Reality: Each cell independently carries out ALL life functions: obtaining energy, removing waste, growing, reproducing, and responding to its environment. A single-celled organism like an amoeba IS a complete living thing.
  Strategy: Ask: Does a cell eat? Breathe? Grow? Reproduce? If yes to all, is it alive?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: If your body is made of 37 trillion cells, why can't you see a single one?
Answer: Cells are microscopic because they MUST be small. A cell needs to exchange nutrients, oxygen, and waste across its membrane, and that exchange only works efficiently at tiny scales. If cells were bigger, the center would starve while waste piled up!

Simulation Answers:
• Starvation Scenario: When Nutrient Supply is locked at 10%, Cell Size decreases steadily. The cell cannot maintain its structures or produce energy. Waste Buildup increases because the cell can't power its cleanup systems. Eventually the cell would die.
• Oxygen Crisis Scenario: At 15% Oxygen Level, Waste Buildup skyrockets because the cell can't perform aerobic respiration efficiently. Cell Size also decreases as the cell shifts to less efficient energy production. This mimics what happens in tissues with poor blood flow.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why can't a cell be basketball-sized?
  A: As a cell grows, its volume (inside) increases much faster than its surface area (membrane). The membrane wouldn't be able to bring in enough nutrients or remove enough waste to keep the huge interior alive. The center of the cell would literally starve while drowning in its own waste.
• Q: How is a cell like a factory?
  A: A cell has a control center (nucleus/DNA), power plants (mitochondria), assembly lines (ribosomes), shipping department (ER and Golgi), and a security fence (cell membrane). Like a factory, if any department fails, the whole operation is affected.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Cell City
Mission: Design a model city where each building represents a cell organelle, showing how resources flow in and waste flows out — just like a real cell.
Scenario: Your city planning team has been hired to design 'Cell City' — a community where every structure has a job, resources must reach every building, and waste removal is critical. Use your model to decide the best layout.
Introduction: Present the challenge: Your team has been hired to design Cell City. Every building has a job, resources must reach every corner, and waste removal is critical. Your city must demonstrate how a real cell works.

Key Concepts:
• Surface Area to Volume Ratio: As objects get larger, their volume grows faster than their surface area. This limits how big cells can get because exchange happens at the surface.
• Organelle Specialization: Just like a city has specialized buildings (hospital, power plant, school), cells have specialized organelles that each perform a critical function.
• Homeostasis: Cells must maintain a stable internal environment. When waste builds up or nutrients run low, the cell's balance is disrupted and it can't function properly.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Cell City accurately represents 4+ organelles, shows resource flow AND waste removal, and connects to model evidence
• Proficient (3): Cell City represents 3+ organelles with clear resource flow, connects to lesson concepts
• Developing (2): Cell City shows some organelles but lacks clear resource/waste flow connections
• Beginning (1): Cell City is incomplete or doesn't connect building functions to cell organelle functions

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a labeled diagram of a cell with organelle functions listed for reference
  • Use physical manipulatives (blocks, beads) to demonstrate surface-area-to-volume ratio
  • Sentence frames: 'When nutrient supply decreases, cell size __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how cancer cells ignore the normal rules of cell size and division
  • Calculate the surface-area-to-volume ratio for cubes of increasing size
  • Compare plant cells to animal cells — what additional structures do plants have?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate surface area and volume of cubes to demonstrate why the ratio changes as cells grow
  • ELA: Write a narrative from the perspective of a nutrient molecule traveling through a cell
  • Art: Create a detailed, labeled diagram of a cell using color-coding for different organelles

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how cell structures work together to keep a cell alive
• Use a model to describe the relationship between cell size and function
• Describe why organisms are organized at the cellular level

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A scientist observes that cells in a low-oxygen environment stop growing and begin to die. Which best explains this observation based on cell structure and function?
• Constructed Response: Using what you know about cells, explain why a single cell cannot grow to be as large as a golf ball. Use the concepts of surface area, volume, and nutrient exchange in your answer.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Cell City
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a model city where each building represents a cell organelle, showing how resources flow in and waste flows out — just like a real cell.

SCENARIO: Your city planning team has been hired to design 'Cell City' — a community where every structure has a job, resources must reach every building, and waste removal is critical. Use your model to decide the best layout.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which organelle-buildings are most important for the city's survival?
• What happens to Cell City if the waste removal system breaks down?
• How does Cell City compare to a real cell under a microscope?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What structures will represent the cell membrane, nucleus, and mitochondria?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will resources (nutrients, oxygen) be delivered throughout your city?

  _________________________________________________________

• What waste removal systems will you include?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you show that every part of the city depends on every other part?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Cell City accurately represents 4+ organelles, shows resource flow AND waste removal, and connects to model evidence
• Proficient (3): Cell City represents 3+ organelles with clear resource flow, connects to lesson concepts
• Developing (2): Cell City shows some organelles but lacks clear resource/waste flow connections
• Beginning (1): Cell City is incomplete or doesn't connect building functions to cell organelle functions
