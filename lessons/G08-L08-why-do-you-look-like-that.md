### Title
**Why Do You Look Like That? — The Genetic Lottery That Made You, You**

### Overview
Every human has approximately 20,000-25,000 genes on 23 pairs of chromosomes. The specific combination of alleles you inherit makes you genetically unique — unless you have an identical twin. Understanding inheritance is key to medicine, agriculture, and evolution. Students investigate the driving question: Why do you look similar to your parents but not exactly like them? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
8th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-LS3-1, MS-LS3-2**: Develop and use a model to describe why structural changes to genes (mutations) located on chromosomes may affect proteins and may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of the organism. Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic information and sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetic variation.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain how genes are passed from parents to offspring through chromosomes
- Model how sexual reproduction creates unique genetic combinations
- Predict trait inheritance patterns using dominant and recessive alleles
- Evaluate why genetic variation is important for species survival

### Component List (Starting Model: 3-4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Parent 1 Alleles | External | The genetic contributions from one parent |
| Parent 2 Alleles | External | The genetic contributions from the other parent |
| Offspring Genotype | Internal | The combination of alleles the offspring inherits |
| Trait Expression (Phenotype) | Internal | The observable physical trait that results from the genotype |

WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE THAT?

The Genetic Lottery That Made You, You.
Why do you look similar to your parents but not exactly like them?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Parent 1 Alleles" — the genetic contributions from one parent
  ○ Click "Parent 2 Alleles" — the genetic contributions from the other parent
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Offspring Genotype" — the combination of alleles the offspring inherits
  ○ Click "Trait Expression (Phenotype)" — the observable physical trait that results from the genotype

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why do you look similar to your parents but not exactly like them?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Parent 1 Alleles' — that's external. The genetic contributions from one parent.
Click on 'Parent 2 Alleles' — that's external. The genetic contributions from the other parent.
Click on 'Offspring Genotype' — that's internal. The combination of alleles the offspring inherits.
Click on 'Trait Expression (Phenotype)' — that's internal. The observable physical trait that results from the genotype.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Parent 1 Alleles and Parent 2 Alleles are external because they are the genetic inputs that existed before the offspring was conceived. Offspring Genotype and Trait Expression are internal because they are determined by the combination of those parental inputs.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Parent 1 Alleles" and drag an arrow to "Offspring Genotype"
• Click on "Parent 2 Alleles" and drag an arrow to "Offspring Genotype"
• Click on "Offspring Genotype" and drag an arrow to "Trait Expression"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Parent 1 Alleles → Offspring Genotype = POSITIVE (+)
    Parent 1's alleles directly contribute to half of the offspring's genetic makeup.

  ○ Parent 2 Alleles → Offspring Genotype = POSITIVE (+)
    Parent 2's alleles contribute the other half of the offspring's genetic makeup.

  ○ Offspring Genotype → Trait Expression = POSITIVE (+)
    The specific allele combination determines which phenotype is expressed based on dominant/recessive rules.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: If both parents carry one dominant and one recessive allele for eye color, what combinations could their child inherit?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Parent 1 Alleles' and drag an arrow
over to 'Offspring Genotype.'

Here's the key question: When parent 1 alleles goes UP, does
offspring genotype go UP or DOWN?

Parent 1's alleles directly contribute to half of the offspring's genetic makeup.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Parent 2 Alleles' and drag an arrow
over to 'Offspring Genotype.'

Here's the key question: When parent 2 alleles goes UP, does
offspring genotype go UP or DOWN?

Parent 2's alleles contribute the other half of the offspring's genetic makeup.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Offspring Genotype' and drag an arrow
over to 'Trait Expression.'

Here's the key question: When offspring genotype goes UP, does
trait expression go UP or DOWN?

The specific allele combination determines which phenotype is expressed based on dominant/recessive rules.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

If both parents carry one dominant and one recessive allele for eye color, what combinations could their child inherit?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Parent 1 Alleles is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — BOTH DOMINANT PARENTS
• BB × BB cross
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict about the offspring's trait expression?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — CARRIER CROSS
• Bb × Bb cross
• PREDICT FIRST: What percentage of offspring do you predict will show the recessive trait?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — MIXED CROSS
• Bb × bb cross
• PREDICT FIRST: What are the possible genotypes of offspring?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• You inherit ONE allele from each parent — your unique combination is why you're genetically unique
• Dominant alleles mask recessive ones, but recessive alleles are still passed on (carriers!)
• The classic Bb × Bb cross produces a 3:1 phenotype ratio (75% dominant, 25% recessive)
• Sexual reproduction creates variation through random allele combinations — that's evolution fuel

THE ANSWER: You inherit a random combination of alleles from both parents. Because each parent has two alleles for every gene and you only get one from each, the combination creates a unique genetic blueprint that makes you similar to — but different from — both parents!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Both Dominant Parents. BB × BB cross.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Carrier Cross.
Bb × Bb cross.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What percentage of offspring do you predict will show the recessive trait?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Mixed Cross. Bb × bb cross.
What are the possible genotypes of offspring?

Here's what our model reveals: You inherit a random combination of alleles from both parents. Because each parent has two alleles for every gene and you only get one from each, the combination creates a unique genetic blueprint that makes you similar to — but different from — both parents!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Parent 1 Alleles?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Parent 2 Alleles?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Mutations — Random changes in DNA that create new alleles
   • Environmental Factors — Non-genetic influences that affect how traits are expressed
   • Multiple Genes — Many traits are controlled by more than one gene

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Chromosomes and Genes — how does this connect to your model?
   • Dominant and Recessive — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why are you genetically unique even among siblings from the same parents?
   • How does sexual reproduction create more variation than asexual reproduction?
   • Why might genetic variation be important for a species' survival?
   • If two brown-eyed parents have a blue-eyed child, how is that possible?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Mutations. Random changes in DNA that create new alleles
How would you model that?

Environmental Factors. Non-genetic influences that affect how traits are expressed
How would you model that?

Multiple Genes. Many traits are controlled by more than one gene
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: Why Do You Look Like That?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Every human has approximately 20,000-25,000 genes on 23 pairs of chromosomes. The specific combination of alleles you inherit makes you genetically unique — unless you have an identical twin. Understanding inheritance is key to medicine, agriculture, and evolution.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS3-1, MS-LS3-2: Develop and use a model to describe why structural changes to genes (mutations) located on chromosomes may affect proteins and may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of the organism. Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic information and sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetic variation.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model to describe how genes on chromosomes determine trait inheritance patterns.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS3.A Inheritance of Traits / LS3.B Variation of Traits
  Organisms reproduce sexually, producing offspring with genetic variation through random allele combination.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify how the CAUSE (specific allele combinations) leads to the EFFECT (observable traits in offspring).

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Allele, Dominant, Recessive, Genotype vs. Phenotype
□ Prepare Why do you look similar to your parents but not exactly like them discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify parent alleles, offspring genotype, and trait expression as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that parent alleles combine to create offspring genotype (positive), and genotype determines phenotype based on dominant/recessive rules.
• Visualize: Students build the inheritance model showing how parental alleles combine in offspring.
• Evaluate: Students run different parent genotype combinations and observe phenotype ratios.
• Revise: Students add mutation or environmental factors to explore more complex inheritance.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Chromosomes and Genes:
  Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes — one set from each parent. Each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of genes. Each gene has a specific location (locus) on a chromosome. You have two copies of every gene (one from each parent), and these copies may be the same or different versions (alleles).

• Dominant and Recessive:
  Dominant alleles (represented by capital letters, like B) are expressed when at least one copy is present. Recessive alleles (lowercase, like b) are only expressed when two copies are present (bb). Heterozygous individuals (Bb) carry the recessive allele but show the dominant trait — they are 'carriers.'

• Sexual vs. Asexual Reproduction:
  Sexual reproduction mixes genetic material from two parents, creating unique offspring through random allele combination. Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring (clones). Genetic variation from sexual reproduction is crucial for species survival because it provides the raw material for natural selection.

• Beyond Simple Inheritance:
  Most human traits aren't controlled by a single gene with simple dominant/recessive patterns. Traits like skin color, height, and intelligence are influenced by multiple genes (polygenic inheritance) AND environmental factors. This is why human diversity is so rich and complex.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Traits blend like paint"
  Reality: Traits don't blend — alleles maintain their identity. A Bb individual doesn't have 'medium' expression. The dominant allele is expressed and the recessive is masked but preserved.
  Strategy: Show that blue-eyed children can come from brown-eyed parents — the blue allele was preserved, not blended away.

• "You look exactly 50% like each parent"
  Reality: You inherit 50% of your DNA from each parent, but WHICH 50% is random. Siblings (except identical twins) get different random halves, which is why they can look very different from each other.
  Strategy: Ask: If you flip two coins 10 times each, will you always get the same results?

• "Dominant means better or more common"
  Reality: Dominant only means the allele is expressed when one copy is present. It doesn't mean it's 'better' or more frequent. Polydactyly (extra fingers) is dominant but rare.
  Strategy: List dominant traits that aren't more common in the population.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do you look similar to your parents but not exactly like them?
Answer: You inherit a random combination of alleles from both parents. Because each parent has two alleles for every gene and you only get one from each, the combination creates a unique genetic blueprint that makes you similar to — but different from — both parents!

Simulation Answers:
• Carrier Cross (Bb × Bb): The model produces offspring in a ~3:1 phenotype ratio: approximately 75% show the dominant trait (BB or Bb genotype) and 25% show the recessive trait (bb genotype). The genotype ratio is 1 BB : 2 Bb : 1 bb.
• Mixed Cross (Bb × bb): The model produces offspring in a ~1:1 phenotype ratio: approximately 50% show the dominant trait (Bb) and 50% show the recessive trait (bb). Every offspring gets a recessive allele from the bb parent.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: How can two brown-eyed parents have a blue-eyed child?
  A: If both parents are carriers (Bb), each has one dominant brown allele and one recessive blue allele. There's a 25% chance they both pass on their recessive allele, creating a bb offspring with blue eyes. The recessive allele was hidden (masked by dominant) but still passed on.
• Q: Why is genetic variation important?
  A: Variation means a population has different traits. If the environment changes (new disease, climate shift), some individuals may have traits that help them survive. Without variation (like in asexual reproduction), every organism is identical and equally vulnerable. This connects to natural selection from L01.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Solve a Genetic Mystery
Mission: Use genetic inheritance patterns to solve a real-world mystery: determine the parents of an unknown organism based on trait evidence.
Scenario: A wildlife conservation team found a rare animal cub. They need to determine which adults are the parents to manage the breeding program. You have trait data for the cub and several potential parents.
Introduction: Present the mystery: A wildlife team found a rare cub. They have trait data (coat color, pattern, etc.) for the cub and 4 potential parent pairs. Students must use genetics to identify the parents.

Key Concepts:
• Process of Elimination: If a cub shows a recessive trait (bb), both parents MUST carry at least one recessive allele.
• Probability: Genetic inheritance deals in probabilities, not certainties. A 25% chance isn't zero.
• Multiple Traits: Using multiple trait analyses increases confidence in parent identification.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Uses Punnett squares for multiple traits, explains reasoning, identifies correct parents with evidence
• Proficient (3): Uses Punnett squares correctly and identifies likely parents
• Developing (2): Shows some inheritance understanding but makes errors in Punnett squares
• Beginning (1): Guesses parents without using genetic reasoning

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide pre-made Punnett square templates
  • Use physical coin flips to model random allele selection
  • Sentence frames: 'The offspring has genotype __ because it inherited __ from parent 1 and __ from parent 2'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research incomplete dominance and codominance and add to model
  • Explore polygenic inheritance — why don't humans come in just two heights?
  • Research genetic testing and its ethical implications

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate probability ratios for multi-trait crosses using multiplication rule
  • ELA: Write a narrative from the perspective of an allele being passed through three generations
  • Social Studies: Research the history of genetics from Mendel to the Human Genome Project

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Use models to describe how gene mutations may affect organisms
• Explain why sexual reproduction produces genetic variation
• Predict offspring phenotypes using inheritance models

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Two parents are both heterozygous (Bb) for a trait. What is the probability that their offspring will show the recessive phenotype?
• Constructed Response: Explain why two siblings with the same parents can look very different from each other. Use the concepts of alleles, dominant/recessive traits, and random combination in your answer.

STEM CHALLENGE: Solve a Genetic Mystery
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Use genetic inheritance patterns to solve a real-world mystery: determine the parents of an unknown organism based on trait evidence.

SCENARIO: A wildlife conservation team found a rare animal cub. They need to determine which adults are the parents to manage the breeding program. You have trait data for the cub and several potential parents.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What traits does the cub express? What are its possible genotypes?
• Which parent combinations could produce this phenotype?
• How can you rule out impossible parent combinations?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What evidence will you use to identify the parents?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you test your hypothesis using Punnett squares?

  _________________________________________________________

• Can you identify the parents with certainty, or only probability?

  _________________________________________________________

• What additional tests might confirm your conclusion?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Uses Punnett squares for multiple traits, explains reasoning, identifies correct parents with evidence
• Proficient (3): Uses Punnett squares correctly and identifies likely parents
• Developing (2): Shows some inheritance understanding but makes errors in Punnett squares
• Beginning (1): Guesses parents without using genetic reasoning
