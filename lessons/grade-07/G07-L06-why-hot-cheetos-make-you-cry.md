### Title
**Why Hot Cheetos Make You Cry — How Your Body's Alarm System Detects and Responds to the World**

### Overview
Your nervous system is the most sophisticated information processing system ever evolved. It detects millions of stimuli per second, transmits signals at highway speeds, and coordinates responses that keep you alive — all without you having to think about it. Students investigate the driving question: How does your body know the difference between hot, cold, sweet, and pain — and why do Hot Cheetos trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

WHY HOT CHEETOS MAKE YOU CRY

How Your Body's Alarm System Detects and Responds to the World.
How does your body know the difference between hot, cold, sweet, and pain — and why do Hot Cheetos trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Stimulus Intensity" — how strong the environmental signal is — dim vs
  ○ Click "Receptor Sensitivity" — how responsive the sensory receptors are — some people have more sensitive receptors than others
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Nerve Signal Strength" — how strong the electrical signal is as it travels from receptors through neurons to the brain
  ○ Click "Brain Response" — the intensity of the brain's reaction — from barely noticing to emergency fight-or-flight

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

### Video Script

"How does your body know the difference between hot, cold, sweet, and pain — and why do Hot Cheetos trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Stimulus Intensity' — that's external. How strong the environmental signal is — dim vs.
Click on 'Receptor Sensitivity' — that's external. How responsive the sensory receptors are — some people have more sensitive receptors than others.
Click on 'Nerve Signal Strength' — that's internal. How strong the electrical signal is as it travels from receptors through neurons to the brain.
Click on 'Brain Response' — that's internal. The intensity of the brain's reaction — from barely noticing to emergency fight-or-flight.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Stimulus Intensity and Receptor Sensitivity are external because they are inputs to the nervous system — the environment provides the stimulus and receptor sensitivity is a pre-existing trait. Nerve Signal Strength and Brain Response are internal because they change as a result of those inputs being processed by the nervous system.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Stimulus Intensity" and drag an arrow to "Nerve Signal Strength"
• Click on "Receptor Sensitivity" and drag an arrow to "Nerve Signal Strength"
• Click on "Nerve Signal Strength" and drag an arrow to "Brain Response"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Stimulus Intensity → Nerve Signal Strength = POSITIVE (+)
    A stronger stimulus activates more receptors and triggers higher-frequency nerve impulses, creating a stronger signal.

  ○ Receptor Sensitivity → Nerve Signal Strength = POSITIVE (+)
    More sensitive receptors fire at lower thresholds and generate stronger signals for the same stimulus level.

  ○ Nerve Signal Strength → Brain Response = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger nerve signals cause more intense brain responses — from barely noticing to full fight-or-flight reactions like crying and sweating.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When stimulus intensity is extremely high (like touching a hot stove), nerve signal strength maxes out. But what happens to brain response — and how fast does it need to happen?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Stimulus Intensity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Nerve Signal Strength.'

Here's the key question: When stimulus intensity goes UP, does
nerve signal strength go UP or DOWN?

A stronger stimulus activates more receptors and triggers higher-frequency nerve impulses, creating a stronger signal.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Receptor Sensitivity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Nerve Signal Strength.'

Here's the key question: When receptor sensitivity goes UP, does
nerve signal strength go UP or DOWN?

More sensitive receptors fire at lower thresholds and generate stronger signals for the same stimulus level.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Nerve Signal Strength' and drag an arrow
over to 'Brain Response.'

Here's the key question: When nerve signal strength goes UP, does
brain response go UP or DOWN?

Stronger nerve signals cause more intense brain responses — from barely noticing to full fight-or-flight reactions like crying and sweating.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When stimulus intensity is extremely high (like touching a hot stove), nerve signal strength maxes out. But what happens to brain response — and how fast does it need to happen?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Stimulus Intensity is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — MILD STIMULUS
• Low stimulus intensity, normal receptor sensitivity
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict Brain Response will be when the stimulus is barely noticeable?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HOT CHEETOS ATTACK
• Maximum stimulus intensity (capsaicin binding to pain receptors)
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Nerve Signal Strength and Brain Response when capsaicin activates pain receptors at full intensity?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — SENSORY ADAPTATION
• Sustained stimulus over time
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Nerve Signal Strength when you experience the same stimulus for a long time?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Different sensory receptors are specialized for different stimuli — you have separate detectors for heat, cold, pressure, and chemicals
• Capsaicin doesn't actually burn you — it activates the SAME heat receptors that real fire would, tricking your brain
• Nerve signals travel at up to 120 meters per second — that's faster than a car on the highway
• Your brain processes millions of sensory inputs simultaneously and decides which ones deserve a response

THE ANSWER: Hot Cheetos make you cry because capsaicin chemically binds to TRPV1 receptors — the same heat/pain receptors that detect actual burning. Your brain receives the signal and responds as if your mouth is literally on fire: tears, sweating, runny nose. It's a chemical trick on your nervous system!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Mild Stimulus. Low stimulus intensity, normal receptor sensitivity.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Hot Cheetos Attack.
Maximum stimulus intensity (capsaicin binding to pain receptors).

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Nerve Signal Strength and Brain Response when capsaicin activates pain receptors at full intensity?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Sensory Adaptation. Sustained stimulus over time.
What do you predict happens to Nerve Signal Strength when you experience the same stimulus for a long time?

Here's what our model reveals: Hot Cheetos make you cry because capsaicin chemically binds to TRPV1 receptors — the same heat/pain receptors that detect actual burning. Your brain receives the signal and responds as if your mouth is literally on fire: tears, sweating, runny nose. It's a chemical trick on your nervous system!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Stimulus Intensity?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Receptor Sensitivity?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Reflex Arc Speed — Some signals bypass the brain entirely — reflexes go from receptor to spinal cord to muscle for faster response
   • Sensory Adaptation — Receptors decrease their firing rate when exposed to a constant stimulus over time
   • Pain Threshold — The minimum stimulus intensity required to trigger a pain response — varies between individuals

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Sensory Receptors — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Capsaicin Trick — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why does your hand pull away from a hot stove BEFORE you consciously feel the pain?
   • If capsaicin doesn't actually damage your mouth, why does your brain respond as if it does?
   • Why do you eventually stop noticing a strong smell after being around it for a while?
   • How would life be different if you had no pain receptors?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Reflex Arc Speed. Some signals bypass the brain entirely — reflexes go from receptor to spinal cord to muscle for faster response
How would you model that?

Sensory Adaptation. Receptors decrease their firing rate when exposed to a constant stimulus over time
How would you model that?

Pain Threshold. The minimum stimulus intensity required to trigger a pain response — varies between individuals
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Hot Cheetos Make You Cry
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Your nervous system is the most sophisticated information processing system ever evolved. It detects millions of stimuli per second, transmits signals at highway speeds, and coordinates responses that keep you alive — all without you having to think about it.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS1-8: Gather and synthesize information that sensory receptors respond to stimuli by sending messages to the brain for immediate behavior or storage as memories.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information
  Students gather and synthesize information about how sensory receptors detect stimuli and communicate with the brain.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.D Information Processing
  Each sense receptor responds to different inputs (light, sound, chemicals), transmitting them as signals that travel along nerve cells to the brain for processing.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify that specific stimuli CAUSE specific receptor activations, which trigger predictable nervous system responses.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Sensory Receptor, Stimulus, Neuron, Capsaicin
□ Prepare How does your body know the difference between hot, cold, sweet, and pain — and why do Hot Cheetos trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify stimulus intensity, receptor sensitivity, nerve signal strength, and brain response as components of the sensory system.
• Establish: Students determine that stimulus intensity and receptor sensitivity both positively affect nerve signal strength, which positively affects brain response.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how environmental stimuli are converted to nerve signals and brain responses.
• Evaluate: Students run mild, capsaicin, and adaptation scenarios to observe how the system responds to different inputs.
• Revise: Students add reflex arc speed or sensory adaptation to explore more complex nervous system behaviors.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Sensory Receptors:
  The human body contains dozens of receptor types: photoreceptors (light), mechanoreceptors (pressure/vibration), thermoreceptors (temperature), chemoreceptors (taste/smell), and nociceptors (pain). Each type responds to a specific stimulus and converts it into electrical nerve signals.

• The Capsaicin Trick:
  Capsaicin, the compound that makes peppers hot, binds to TRPV1 receptors — the same receptors that detect temperatures above 43°C (109°F). When capsaicin activates these receptors, the brain receives a signal indistinguishable from actual burning. The response is real (tears, sweating, pain) even though no tissue damage occurs.

• Signal Transmission:
  Nerve signals are electrical impulses that travel along neurons at speeds of 1-120 m/s depending on the nerve type. The signal passes from neuron to neuron across tiny gaps called synapses using chemical neurotransmitters. From stubbed toe to brain awareness takes about 0.1 seconds.

• Brain Processing:
  The brain receives sensory input and decides the response: ignore it (background noise), store it (memories), or act on it (pull hand away). The somatosensory cortex maps which body part sent the signal. Pain signals get priority processing — your brain is wired to respond to danger first.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Spicy food burns your mouth"
  Reality: Capsaicin doesn't cause any tissue damage or burning. It binds to heat receptors (TRPV1) and tricks your brain into THINKING you're being burned. The pain is real, but the injury is not.
  Strategy: Ask: If spicy food actually burned you, would your mouth heal overnight? The fact that it does proves no damage occurred.

• "We only have five senses"
  Reality: Humans have far more than five senses. Beyond sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, we have proprioception (body position), vestibular sense (balance), thermoception (temperature), nociception (pain), and more.
  Strategy: Close your eyes and touch your nose. How did you know where it was? That's proprioception — your sixth sense.

• "Pain is always bad"
  Reality: Pain is actually a critical survival system. It alerts your brain to danger and triggers protective responses. People born without pain receptors (a real condition) suffer constant injuries because they can't detect damage.
  Strategy: Ask: Would you want to NOT feel pain? What would happen if you left your hand on a hot stove and didn't know?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How does your body know the difference between hot, cold, sweet, and pain — and why do Hot Cheetos trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire?
Answer: Hot Cheetos make you cry because capsaicin chemically binds to TRPV1 receptors — the same heat/pain receptors that detect actual burning. Your brain receives the signal and responds as if your mouth is literally on fire: tears, sweating, runny nose. It's a chemical trick on your nervous system!

Simulation Answers:
• Hot Cheetos Scenario: When Stimulus Intensity is maxed (capsaicin binding to TRPV1 pain receptors), Nerve Signal Strength shoots to maximum. Brain Response is intense — the brain triggers tears, sweating, mucus production, and pain sensation. The response is identical to actual burning because the same receptors are activated.
• Sensory Adaptation Scenario: When a sustained stimulus continues over time, Nerve Signal Strength gradually decreases as receptors adapt and reduce their firing rate. Brain Response diminishes. This is why you stop noticing a strong perfume after a few minutes — your receptors have adapted.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does your hand pull away before you feel pain?
  A: Reflexes bypass the brain entirely. The pain signal goes from receptors to the spinal cord, which immediately sends a motor signal back to your arm muscles to pull away. The signal reaches your brain AFTER your hand has already moved. This reflex arc takes about 0.05 seconds — your conscious awareness of pain comes later.
• Q: Why does capsaicin trigger pain but not damage?
  A: Capsaicin binds to TRPV1 receptors, which normally detect temperatures above 43°C. The receptor can't tell the difference between real heat and capsaicin — it sends the same signal either way. Your brain responds to the signal, not the actual stimulus. No cells are damaged, but the pain response is genuine.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Sensory Experiment
Mission: Design and conduct a controlled experiment testing how different variables affect sensory perception — then explain your results using your nervous system model.
Scenario: A neuroscience lab needs student researchers to investigate sensory perception. Your team will design an experiment, collect data, and present findings about how the nervous system processes sensory information.
Introduction: Your team is a neuroscience research group. Design a controlled experiment testing a question about sensory perception — then present your findings to the class as a scientific poster.

Key Concepts:
• Receptor Specificity: Different receptors respond to different stimuli. TRPV1 detects heat and capsaicin. TRPM8 detects cold and menthol. Taste receptors detect sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.
• Signal Transduction: The process of converting an environmental stimulus (heat, light, chemicals) into an electrical nerve signal that the brain can interpret.
• Sensory Adaptation: When exposed to a constant stimulus, receptors gradually decrease their firing rate. This is why you stop noticing background noise or constant odors after a while.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Experiment has clear hypothesis, controlled variables, multiple trials, data collection, and connects results to the nervous system model
• Proficient (3): Experiment has a hypothesis and controlled variables, with data that connects to sensory concepts
• Developing (2): Experiment tests a sensory question but lacks controlled variables or clear data collection
• Beginning (1): Experiment is incomplete or doesn't connect to nervous system concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a diagram of the sensory pathway: stimulus → receptor → nerve → brain → response
  • Use a reaction time test (ruler drop) to physically demonstrate nerve signal speed
  • Sentence frames: 'When stimulus intensity increases, nerve signal strength __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research phantom limb pain and explain how the brain can perceive sensations from missing body parts
  • Test reaction times under different conditions and calculate nerve signal speed
  • Investigate how anesthetics block nerve signals and prevent pain perception

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate nerve signal speed by measuring reaction time and estimating the distance signals travel
  • ELA: Write a narrative describing the journey of a nerve signal from tongue (Hot Cheeto) to brain to tears
  • Health: Research how understanding pain receptors helps develop better pain medications for patients

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how sensory receptors respond to different types of stimuli
• Describe how signals travel from receptors to the brain
• Analyze how the brain processes sensory information for behavior or memory

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A person eats a Hot Cheeto and immediately starts sweating and tearing up. This response occurs because capsaicin in the chip:
• Constructed Response: Describe the pathway a signal takes from the moment you touch something hot to the moment you pull your hand away. Explain the role of sensory receptors, neurons, and the brain in this process.

REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Why does your hand pull away from a hot stove BEFORE you consciously feel the pain?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. If capsaicin doesn't actually damage your mouth, why does your brain respond as if it does?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. Why do you eventually stop noticing a strong smell after being around it for a while?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. How would life be different if you had no pain receptors?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. How does understanding sensory receptors help doctors treat conditions like chronic pain?

   _________________________________________________________

POST-ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. How does your body know the difference between hot, cold, sweet, and pain — and why do Hot Cheetos trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire? Explain using evidence from your model:

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Sensory Experiment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design and conduct a controlled experiment testing how different variables affect sensory perception — then explain your results using your nervous system model.

SCENARIO: A neuroscience lab needs student researchers to investigate sensory perception. Your team will design an experiment, collect data, and present findings about how the nervous system processes sensory information.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What sensory perception question will your experiment investigate?
• How will you control variables to ensure your results are valid?
• How do your experimental results connect to your nervous system model?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What specific sensory question are you testing (taste, touch, temperature, sight)?

  _________________________________________________________

• What is your independent variable and how will you change it?

  _________________________________________________________

• What is your dependent variable and how will you measure it?

  _________________________________________________________

• How many trials will you run and why?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Experiment has clear hypothesis, controlled variables, multiple trials, data collection, and connects results to the nervous system model
• Proficient (3): Experiment has a hypothesis and controlled variables, with data that connects to sensory concepts
• Developing (2): Experiment tests a sensory question but lacks controlled variables or clear data collection
• Beginning (1): Experiment is incomplete or doesn't connect to nervous system concepts
