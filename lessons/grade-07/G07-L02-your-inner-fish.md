### Title
**Your Inner Fish — Why You Share Bones with a 375-Million-Year-Old Fish**

### Overview
The fossil record provides overwhelming evidence that life on Earth has changed dramatically over billions of years. By studying fossils and comparing anatomy, scientists reconstruct evolutionary relationships and understand how modern organisms are connected to ancient life. Students investigate the driving question: Why do humans have the same bones as a fish that lived 375 million years ago? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

YOUR INNER FISH

Why You Share Bones with a 375-Million-Year-Old Fish.
Why do humans have the same bones as a fish that lived 375 million years ago?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Environmental Change Rate" — how quickly an environment changes — temperature
  ○ Click "Time (Millions of Years)" — the geological timescale over which evolution occurs
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Anatomical Similarity" — how much structural resemblance exists between different species' body plans
  ○ Click "Species Diversity" — the number of different species that exist in an ecosystem at any given time

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why do humans have the same bones as a fish that lived 375 million years ago?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Environmental Change Rate' — that's external. How quickly an environment changes — temperature.
Click on 'Time (Millions of Years)' — that's external. The geological timescale over which evolution occurs.
Click on 'Anatomical Similarity' — that's internal. How much structural resemblance exists between different species' body plans.
Click on 'Species Diversity' — that's internal. The number of different species that exist in an ecosystem at any given time.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Environmental Change Rate and Time are external because organisms can't control how fast the environment changes or how much time passes. Anatomical Similarity and Species Diversity are internal because they change as a result of evolutionary responses to those external pressures.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Environmental Change Rate" and drag an arrow to "Species Diversity"
• Click on "Time (Millions of Years)" and drag an arrow to "Anatomical Similarity"
• Click on "Species Diversity" and drag an arrow to "Anatomical Similarity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Environmental Change Rate → Species Diversity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Rapid environmental change causes extinctions, reducing the number of species. Organisms that can't adapt fast enough go extinct.

  ○ Time (Millions of Years) → Anatomical Similarity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Over longer time periods, species diverge more from common ancestors, reducing anatomical similarity between distant relatives.

  ○ Species Diversity → Anatomical Similarity = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher species diversity means more organisms share recent common ancestors, retaining more similar body structures.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 1 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When environmental change rate increases dramatically, what happens to species diversity? Does it always go up, or can it crash?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Environmental Change Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Species Diversity.'

Here's the key question: When environmental change rate goes UP, does
species diversity go UP or DOWN?

Rapid environmental change causes extinctions, reducing the number of species. Organisms that can't adapt fast enough go extinct.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Time (Millions of Years)' and drag an arrow
over to 'Anatomical Similarity.'

Here's the key question: When time (millions of years) goes UP, does
anatomical similarity go UP or DOWN?

Over longer time periods, species diverge more from common ancestors, reducing anatomical similarity between distant relatives.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Species Diversity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Anatomical Similarity.'

Here's the key question: When species diversity goes UP, does
anatomical similarity go UP or DOWN?

Higher species diversity means more organisms share recent common ancestors, retaining more similar body structures.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 1
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When environmental change rate increases dramatically, what happens to species diversity? Does it always go up, or can it crash?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Environmental Change Rate is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — STABLE ENVIRONMENT
• Low environmental change, long time period
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Species Diversity when the environment stays stable for millions of years?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — MASS EXTINCTION
• Environmental Change Rate at maximum
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Species Diversity during rapid environmental change?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — GRADUAL CHANGE
• Moderate change over a long time period
• PREDICT FIRST: How do you predict Anatomical Similarity between related species changes over millions of years?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Species that can't adapt to environmental change go extinct — creating gaps in the fossil record
• Homologous structures prove that very different-looking animals evolved from common ancestors
• Mass extinction events reduce diversity temporarily but open ecological niches for new species
• The fossil record shows a clear pattern: simple organisms came first, complexity increased over time

THE ANSWER: Humans share bones with ancient fish because we evolved from the same common ancestor. The fossil Tiktaalik (375 million years old) shows the transition from fins to limbs. Our arm bones — humerus, radius, ulna — are the SAME bones, modified over millions of years through evolution!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Stable Environment. Low environmental change, long time period.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Mass Extinction.
Environmental Change Rate at maximum.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Species Diversity during rapid environmental change?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Gradual Change. Moderate change over a long time period.
How do you predict Anatomical Similarity between related species changes over millions of years?

Here's what our model reveals: Humans share bones with ancient fish because we evolved from the same common ancestor. The fossil Tiktaalik (375 million years old) shows the transition from fins to limbs. Our arm bones — humerus, radius, ulna — are the SAME bones, modified over millions of years through evolution!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Environmental Change Rate?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Time (Millions of Years)?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Mutation Rate — How quickly random genetic changes occur in populations, creating variation
   • Geographic Isolation — When populations are separated by physical barriers, preventing gene flow
   • Ecological Niche Availability — The number of open habitats and food sources available for new species

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Fossil Record — how does this connect to your model?
   • Homologous Structures — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How does finding the same bone structure in fish, frogs, birds, and humans support evolution?
   • Why are transitional fossils like Tiktaalik so important to scientists?
   • What would happen to the fossil record if a massive asteroid hit Earth today?
   • How is your model similar to and different from real evolution?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Mutation Rate. How quickly random genetic changes occur in populations, creating variation
How would you model that?

Geographic Isolation. When populations are separated by physical barriers, preventing gene flow
How would you model that?

Ecological Niche Availability. The number of open habitats and food sources available for new species
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The fossil record provides overwhelming evidence that life on Earth has changed dramatically over billions of years. By studying fossils and comparing anatomy, scientists reconstruct evolutionary relationships and understand how modern organisms are connected to ancient life.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS4-1, MS-LS4-2: Analyze and interpret data for patterns in the fossil record that document the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of life forms throughout the history of life on Earth. Apply scientific ideas to construct an explanation for the anatomical similarities and differences among modern organisms and between modern and fossil organisms to infer evolutionary relationships.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Analyzing and Interpreting Data
  Students analyze patterns in fossil evidence and anatomical data to construct explanations of evolutionary relationships.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS4.A Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity
  The fossil record documents the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of many life forms throughout history.
• Crosscutting Concept: Patterns
  Students identify patterns of anatomical similarity across species and through geological time as evidence of common ancestry.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Fossil Record, Homologous Structure, Common Ancestor, Transitional Fossil
□ Prepare Why do humans have the same bones as a fish that lived 375 million years ago discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify environmental change rate, geological time, anatomical similarity, and species diversity as components of the evolutionary system.
• Establish: Students determine that environmental change drives both extinction (reducing diversity) and adaptation (changing anatomy over time).
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how environmental pressures and time interact to produce changes in species diversity and body structure.
• Evaluate: Students run stable, mass extinction, and gradual change scenarios to observe different evolutionary outcomes.
• Revise: Students add mutation rate or geographic isolation to explore more realistic evolutionary dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Fossil Record:
  Fossils form when organisms are buried in sediment before decomposition. Over millions of years, minerals replace organic material. The fossil record is incomplete — fossilization is rare — but it provides a clear timeline showing how life has changed across Earth's history.

• Homologous Structures:
  The arm of a human, the wing of a bat, the flipper of a whale, and the leg of a dog all contain the same basic bones: humerus, radius, and ulna. These homologous structures have the same evolutionary origin but have been modified for different functions, providing strong evidence for common ancestry.

• Tiktaalik: Your Inner Fish:
  In 2004, paleontologist Neil Shubin discovered Tiktaalik roseae, a 375-million-year-old fossil bridging fish and land animals. It had fish features (scales, fins) AND land features (flat head, neck, primitive wrist bones). It's one of the most famous transitional fossils ever found.

• Extinction and Diversification:
  Earth has experienced at least five mass extinction events. The most famous killed the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But extinctions also open ecological niches — after the dinosaurs disappeared, mammals diversified rapidly, eventually leading to primates and humans.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Humans evolved from monkeys"
  Reality: Humans and modern apes share a common ancestor from about 6-7 million years ago. We didn't evolve FROM chimpanzees — we're evolutionary cousins. Both species have been evolving separately.
  Strategy: Draw a family tree. Ask: Did you evolve from your cousin? No — you share a grandparent.

• "Evolution is just a theory"
  Reality: In science, 'theory' means a well-tested explanation supported by massive evidence. Evolution is supported by fossils, genetics, anatomy, and direct observation. Gravity is also 'just a theory.'
  Strategy: Compare everyday 'theory' (guess) with scientific 'theory' (tested explanation).

• "Fossils should show every step"
  Reality: Fossilization is extremely rare — most organisms decompose completely. The fossil record will always have gaps, but the fossils we DO have consistently support evolutionary patterns.
  Strategy: Ask: If you lost most pages of a book but kept every 10th page, could you still figure out the story?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why do humans have the same bones as a fish that lived 375 million years ago?
Answer: Humans share bones with ancient fish because we evolved from the same common ancestor. The fossil Tiktaalik (375 million years old) shows the transition from fins to limbs. Our arm bones — humerus, radius, ulna — are the SAME bones, modified over millions of years through evolution!

Simulation Answers:
• Mass Extinction Scenario: When Environmental Change Rate is maximized, Species Diversity crashes rapidly. Many species can't adapt fast enough. However, after change stabilizes, surviving species can diversify into empty niches. Anatomical Similarity decreases as survivors adapt to new environments.
• Gradual Change Scenario: With moderate change over long Time, Species Diversity stays relatively stable as organisms gradually adapt. Anatomical Similarity slowly decreases between diverging lineages, but homologous structures remain detectable even after millions of years.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why do different animals share the same bones?
  A: Homologous structures exist because all these animals evolved from the same common ancestor. The bones were inherited from that ancestor and modified over millions of years for different functions: grabbing, swimming, flying, and running.
• Q: Why do we still have fish?
  A: Humans didn't evolve FROM modern fish — we share a common ancestor WITH modern fish. About 375 million years ago, some fish-like creatures evolved features for land life, while others continued thriving in water. Both lineages kept evolving separately.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Build an Evolutionary Evidence Wall
Mission: Create a visual display showing evidence for evolution from the fossil record, including homologous structures and transitional fossils, for a natural history museum.
Scenario: A natural history museum needs a new exhibit showing how scientists use fossils and anatomy to trace evolutionary relationships. Your team will design the exhibit using evidence from your model.
Introduction: A natural history museum wants a new exhibit showing how fossils and anatomy prove evolutionary relationships. Your team will design an evidence wall telling the story of evolution from ancient fish to modern humans.

Key Concepts:
• Homologous vs. Analogous: Homologous structures share the same origin (whale flipper = human arm). Analogous structures serve similar functions but have different origins (bird wing vs. butterfly wing). Only homologous structures prove common ancestry.
• Transitional Fossils: Fossils like Tiktaalik show features of two different groups, providing direct evidence of evolutionary transitions between major groups of organisms.
• Biogeography: The geographic distribution of species provides additional evidence — similar environments on different continents produce similar but unrelated species through convergent evolution.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Evidence wall includes homologous structures, transitional fossils, timeline, and clearly explains evolutionary relationships with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Evidence wall shows multiple types of evidence and connects them to evolutionary relationships
• Developing (2): Evidence wall includes some evidence but doesn't clearly connect it to evolution
• Beginning (1): Evidence wall is incomplete or shows misconceptions about evolutionary evidence

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide printed diagrams of homologous structures in 5 different animals for comparison
  • Use a simplified geological timeline with major events pre-labeled
  • Sentence frames: 'The fact that __ and __ share the same __ suggests they __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research vestigial structures (human appendix, whale hip bones) as additional evolution evidence
  • Compare embryological development across vertebrate species for shared patterns
  • Create a cladogram showing evolutionary relationships between 6 species using anatomical data

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Create a proportional timeline showing major evolutionary events across 4.5 billion years
  • ELA: Read excerpts from Neil Shubin's 'Your Inner Fish' and summarize the key evidence
  • Social Studies: Research how different cultures and time periods understood the origin of species

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Analyze fossil data to identify patterns of change over geological time
• Construct explanations for anatomical similarities between modern and ancient organisms
• Use evidence from the fossil record to support evolutionary relationships

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A scientist discovers that the flipper of a whale, the wing of a bat, and the arm of a human all contain the same bones. What does this evidence most likely indicate?
• Constructed Response: Using evidence from the fossil record, explain how scientists know that modern land vertebrates evolved from ancient fish. Include at least two types of evidence.

STEM CHALLENGE: Build an Evolutionary Evidence Wall
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Create a visual display showing evidence for evolution from the fossil record, including homologous structures and transitional fossils, for a natural history museum.

SCENARIO: A natural history museum needs a new exhibit showing how scientists use fossils and anatomy to trace evolutionary relationships. Your team will design the exhibit using evidence from your model.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What fossil evidence most clearly shows evolutionary relationships?
• How do you visually show homologous structures across different species?
• What story does your evidence wall tell about the history of life?

DESIGN THINKING:
• Which transitional fossils will you feature and why?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you show homologous structures between fish, reptiles, and mammals?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you represent the timeline of evolution visually?

  _________________________________________________________

• What interactive elements will help visitors understand the evidence?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Evidence wall includes homologous structures, transitional fossils, timeline, and clearly explains evolutionary relationships with model evidence
• Proficient (3): Evidence wall shows multiple types of evidence and connects them to evolutionary relationships
• Developing (2): Evidence wall includes some evidence but doesn't clearly connect it to evolution
• Beginning (1): Evidence wall is incomplete or shows misconceptions about evolutionary evidence
