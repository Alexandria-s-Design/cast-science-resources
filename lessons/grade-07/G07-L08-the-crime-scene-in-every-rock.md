### Title
**The Crime Scene in Every Rock — Reading Earth's History One Layer at a Time**

### Overview
Earth is 4.6 billion years old, and its history is written in stone — literally. Rock strata (layers) form a record of environmental conditions, life forms, and geological events that have shaped our planet over deep time. Students investigate the driving question: How can a single rock tell you what happened on Earth millions of years ago? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE CRIME SCENE IN EVERY ROCK

Reading Earth's History One Layer at a Time.
How can a single rock tell you what happened on Earth millions of years ago?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Sedimentation Rate" — how quickly new layers of sediment are deposited by water
  ○ Click "Erosion Rate" — how quickly existing rock layers are worn away by water
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Rock Layer Thickness" — how thick the accumulated rock strata become over geological time
  ○ Click "Fossil Preservation Quality" — how well organisms are preserved in the rock — depends on burial speed and conditions

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"How can a single rock tell you what happened on Earth millions of years ago?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Sedimentation Rate' — that's external. How quickly new layers of sediment are deposited by water.
Click on 'Erosion Rate' — that's external. How quickly existing rock layers are worn away by water.
Click on 'Rock Layer Thickness' — that's internal. How thick the accumulated rock strata become over geological time.
Click on 'Fossil Preservation Quality' — that's internal. How well organisms are preserved in the rock — depends on burial speed and conditions.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Sedimentation Rate and Erosion Rate are external because they are geological processes driven by environmental forces — water, wind, volcanism, and gravity — that the rock itself cannot control. Rock Layer Thickness and Fossil Preservation Quality are internal because they are outcomes that change based on the balance between sedimentation and erosion.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Sedimentation Rate" and drag an arrow to "Rock Layer Thickness"
• Click on "Erosion Rate" and drag an arrow to "Rock Layer Thickness"
• Click on "Rock Layer Thickness" and drag an arrow to "Fossil Preservation Quality"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Sedimentation Rate → Rock Layer Thickness = POSITIVE (+)
    Faster sedimentation means more material is deposited, creating thicker rock layers over time.

  ○ Erosion Rate → Rock Layer Thickness = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher erosion rates wear away existing layers, reducing thickness and creating gaps (unconformities) in the rock record.

  ○ Rock Layer Thickness → Fossil Preservation Quality = POSITIVE (+)
    Thicker, more rapidly deposited layers bury organisms quickly, protecting them from decomposition and creating better-preserved fossils.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When sedimentation rate is very high (like during a flood or volcanic eruption), what happens to fossil preservation quality compared to normal, slow deposition?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Sedimentation Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Rock Layer Thickness.'

Here's the key question: When sedimentation rate goes UP, does
rock layer thickness go UP or DOWN?

Faster sedimentation means more material is deposited, creating thicker rock layers over time.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Erosion Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Rock Layer Thickness.'

Here's the key question: When erosion rate goes UP, does
rock layer thickness go UP or DOWN?

Higher erosion rates wear away existing layers, reducing thickness and creating gaps (unconformities) in the rock record.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Rock Layer Thickness' and drag an arrow
over to 'Fossil Preservation Quality.'

Here's the key question: When rock layer thickness goes UP, does
fossil preservation quality go UP or DOWN?

Thicker, more rapidly deposited layers bury organisms quickly, protecting them from decomposition and creating better-preserved fossils.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When sedimentation rate is very high (like during a flood or volcanic eruption), what happens to fossil preservation quality compared to normal, slow deposition?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Sedimentation Rate is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — RAPID DEPOSITION
• Sedimentation Rate at maximum (flood event)
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Fossil Preservation Quality when organisms are buried quickly?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HEAVY EROSION
• Erosion Rate at maximum, normal sedimentation
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Rock Layer Thickness and fossil evidence when erosion dominates?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — BALANCED SYSTEM
• Moderate sedimentation and erosion
• PREDICT FIRST: How do you predict the rock record forms under normal conditions over millions of years?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Rock layers are like pages in a book — each one records conditions at the time it formed
• Rapid burial preserves fossils best because organisms are protected from decomposition and scavengers
• Erosion creates gaps in the rock record — millions of years of history can be missing from a single location
• The principle of superposition allows us to determine which layers (and fossils) are older or younger

THE ANSWER: Rocks are history books written in stone. Each layer records the environment when it formed — ocean sediments contain marine fossils, desert layers contain sand dunes, volcanic layers contain ash. By reading layers from bottom to top (superposition), we can reconstruct millions of years of Earth's story!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Rapid Deposition. Sedimentation Rate at maximum (flood event).
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Heavy Erosion.
Erosion Rate at maximum, normal sedimentation.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Rock Layer Thickness and fossil evidence when erosion dominates?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Balanced System. Moderate sedimentation and erosion.
How do you predict the rock record forms under normal conditions over millions of years?

Here's what our model reveals: Rocks are history books written in stone. Each layer records the environment when it formed — ocean sediments contain marine fossils, desert layers contain sand dunes, volcanic layers contain ash. By reading layers from bottom to top (superposition), we can reconstruct millions of years of Earth's story!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Sedimentation Rate?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Erosion Rate?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Tectonic Activity — Earthquakes, folding, and faulting can tilt, bend, or break rock layers after they form
   • Sea Level Change — Rising and falling oceans change what type of sediment is deposited in an area
   • Volcanic Eruptions — Volcanic ash creates distinct marker layers that can be dated and traced across continents

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • How Rock Layers Form — how does this connect to your model?
   • Principle of Superposition — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is the fossil record incomplete — why don't we have fossils of every organism that ever lived?
   • How does finding marine fossils on mountaintops prove that Earth's surface has changed dramatically?
   • What's the difference between relative age (superposition) and absolute age (radiometric dating)?
   • Why are sedimentary rocks the best type for finding fossils?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Tectonic Activity. Earthquakes, folding, and faulting can tilt, bend, or break rock layers after they form
How would you model that?

Sea Level Change. Rising and falling oceans change what type of sediment is deposited in an area
How would you model that?

Volcanic Eruptions. Volcanic ash creates distinct marker layers that can be dated and traced across continents
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Crime Scene in Every Rock
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Earth is 4.6 billion years old, and its history is written in stone — literally. Rock strata (layers) form a record of environmental conditions, life forms, and geological events that have shaped our planet over deep time.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS1-4: Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence from rock strata for how the geologic time scale is used to organize Earth's 4.6-billion-year-old history.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Constructing Explanations
  Students construct scientific explanations using evidence from rock strata to explain how geologists organize Earth's history.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS1.C The History of Planet Earth
  Rock strata and the fossil record can be used as evidence to organize the relative occurrence of major historical events in Earth's history.
• Crosscutting Concept: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity
  Students work with vast timescales (millions to billions of years) and understand how thin layers of rock can represent enormous spans of geological time.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Stratigraphy, Sedimentary Rock, Superposition, Index Fossil
□ Prepare How can a single rock tell you what happened on Earth millions of years ago discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify sedimentation rate, erosion rate, rock layer thickness, and fossil preservation quality as components of the geological record system.
• Establish: Students determine that sedimentation builds layers while erosion destroys them, and that rapid burial improves fossil preservation.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how sedimentation and erosion interact to create (or destroy) the rock record.
• Evaluate: Students run rapid deposition, heavy erosion, and balanced scenarios to observe different geological outcomes.
• Revise: Students add tectonic activity or sea level change to explore how geological forces alter the record after formation.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• How Rock Layers Form:
  Sedimentary rock forms when particles (sand, mud, shells, organic material) settle and accumulate in layers. Over millions of years, pressure from overlying layers compresses and cements these sediments into solid rock. Each layer represents a specific time period and environment.

• Principle of Superposition:
  In undisturbed rock sequences, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. This principle, established by Nicolas Steno in 1669, allows geologists to determine the RELATIVE age of rock layers and the fossils they contain without needing absolute dates.

• Fossils as Evidence:
  Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of ancient organisms. They form when organisms are rapidly buried in sediment before decomposition. Index fossils — from organisms that lived for a short time but across a wide geographic area — are especially useful for dating and correlating rock layers across distant locations.

• Gaps in the Record:
  Unconformities are gaps in the rock record where erosion has removed layers or deposition didn't occur. These represent missing time — potentially millions of years of history erased. Geologists identify three types: angular unconformities, disconformities, and nonconformities.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Rocks don't change"
  Reality: Rocks are constantly being created, destroyed, and recycled through the rock cycle. Sedimentary rocks can be metamorphosed by heat and pressure, melted into magma, or eroded into sediment that forms new rock. Earth's surface is dynamic.
  Strategy: Show images of the same location millions of years apart. Ask: Does this look like nothing changed?

• "Fossils are just pretty rocks"
  Reality: Fossils are preserved evidence of ancient life — they contain critical information about what organisms existed, what the environment was like, and how life has changed over time. Each fossil is a data point in the story of evolution.
  Strategy: Give students real or replica fossils. Ask: What can you learn about this organism and its world from just this rock?

• "The Earth has always looked like it does now"
  Reality: Earth's surface has changed dramatically over 4.6 billion years. Continents have moved, oceans have appeared and disappeared, mountains have risen and eroded away. The landscape you see today is just a snapshot of an ever-changing planet.
  Strategy: Show a time-lapse animation of continental drift from Pangaea to present. Earth never stays the same.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How can a single rock tell you what happened on Earth millions of years ago?
Answer: Rocks are history books written in stone. Each layer records the environment when it formed — ocean sediments contain marine fossils, desert layers contain sand dunes, volcanic layers contain ash. By reading layers from bottom to top (superposition), we can reconstruct millions of years of Earth's story!

Simulation Answers:
• Rapid Deposition Scenario: When Sedimentation Rate is maximized (simulating a flood or volcanic ash fall), Rock Layer Thickness increases rapidly. Fossil Preservation Quality is excellent because organisms are buried quickly before they can decompose. This is why many of the best fossil sites are locations of ancient floods or volcanic events.
• Heavy Erosion Scenario: When Erosion Rate dominates, Rock Layer Thickness decreases as layers are worn away. Fossil Preservation Quality drops because exposed fossils are destroyed by weathering. Heavy erosion creates unconformities — gaps where millions of years of history are simply MISSING from the record.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is the fossil record incomplete?
  A: Three main reasons: (1) Most organisms decompose before fossilization — you need rapid burial in the right conditions. (2) Erosion destroys existing fossils and rock layers. (3) Tectonic activity can metamorphose or melt fossil-bearing rocks. Scientists estimate we've found less than 1% of all species that have ever lived.
• Q: How do marine fossils end up on mountaintops?
  A: Millions of years ago, those rocks formed at the bottom of an ancient ocean. Marine organisms died and were buried in ocean sediment. Over millions of years, tectonic forces uplifted those ocean-floor rocks thousands of feet into the air, creating mountains. The fossils traveled with the rock from ocean floor to mountaintop.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Create a Rock Core Sample Model
Mission: Build a physical model of a rock core sample showing at least 5 distinct geological periods, each with appropriate fossils and environmental evidence.
Scenario: A museum of natural history needs an educational core sample exhibit showing how geologists read Earth's history from rock layers. Your team will build the model and write the interpretive guide.
Introduction: A natural history museum needs a core sample exhibit showing Earth's history. Your team will build a physical model with at least 5 distinct layers, each containing evidence of the environment at that time period.

Key Concepts:
• Relative vs. Absolute Dating: Relative dating (superposition) tells you which layer is older. Absolute dating (radiometric) tells you exactly how old a layer is in years. Both are essential for constructing geological timelines.
• Unconformities: Gaps in the rock record where layers are missing due to erosion or non-deposition. They represent lost time — potentially millions of years with no geological record at that location.
• Correlation: Geologists match rock layers across different locations using index fossils and distinctive marker layers (like volcanic ash). This allows them to reconstruct regional and global geological histories.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Core sample has 5+ distinct layers, each with appropriate evidence, shows at least one unconformity, and includes an interpretive guide explaining the history
• Proficient (3): Core sample has distinct layers with evidence and student can explain the geological history using superposition
• Developing (2): Core sample has some layers but evidence or explanation is vague
• Beginning (1): Core sample is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of rock strata principles

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified geological column showing major eras with example fossils
  • Use pre-made layer kits with sand, clay, gravel, and small toy fossils
  • Sentence frames: 'This layer is __ (older/younger) than that layer because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research radiometric dating and explain how scientists determine absolute age of rocks
  • Investigate a local geological formation and identify the rock types and history it represents
  • Create a geological timeline of your state showing major events recorded in local rock strata

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate sedimentation rates given layer thickness and time period — how many mm per year?
  • ELA: Write a detective story where the clues are all found in rock layers at a geological site
  • Social Studies: Research how geological knowledge helped early civilizations find water, minerals, and building materials

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Use evidence from rock strata to organize events in Earth's history
• Apply the principle of superposition to determine relative age of rock layers
• Construct explanations for how geological processes create the rock record

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A geologist finds a rock layer containing marine fossils between two layers containing land plant fossils. Which interpretation is best supported by this evidence?
• Constructed Response: Examine a diagram of rock strata with different fossils in each layer. Using the principle of superposition and your knowledge of the fossil record, construct an explanation of the geological history this sequence represents.

REFLECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Why is the fossil record incomplete — why don't we have fossils of every organism that ever lived?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

2. How does finding marine fossils on mountaintops prove that Earth's surface has changed dramatically?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

3. What's the difference between relative age (superposition) and absolute age (radiometric dating)?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

4. Why are sedimentary rocks the best type for finding fossils?

   _________________________________________________________

   _________________________________________________________

5. How does erosion act like a thief, stealing pages from Earth's history book?

STEM CHALLENGE: Create a Rock Core Sample Model
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Build a physical model of a rock core sample showing at least 5 distinct geological periods, each with appropriate fossils and environmental evidence.

SCENARIO: A museum of natural history needs an educational core sample exhibit showing how geologists read Earth's history from rock layers. Your team will build the model and write the interpretive guide.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What evidence in each layer tells you about the environment at that time?
• How do you show the principle of superposition in your core sample?
• What would a gap (unconformity) in your layers represent?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How many geological periods will your core sample represent?

  _________________________________________________________

• What materials will represent different types of sediment and rock?

  _________________________________________________________

• What fossils or evidence will you include in each layer?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you show at least one erosion gap (unconformity) in your record?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Core sample has 5+ distinct layers, each with appropriate evidence, shows at least one unconformity, and includes an interpretive guide explaining the history
• Proficient (3): Core sample has distinct layers with evidence and student can explain the geological history using superposition
• Developing (2): Core sample has some layers but evidence or explanation is vague
• Beginning (1): Core sample is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate understanding of rock strata principles
