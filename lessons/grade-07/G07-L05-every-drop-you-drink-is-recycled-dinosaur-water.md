### Title
**Every Drop You Drink Is Recycled Dinosaur Water — The Never-Ending Journey of Water on Earth**

### Overview
Water is the most important substance on Earth for supporting life. The water cycle — driven by solar energy and gravity — has been recycling the same water molecules for over 4 billion years, connecting every ocean, river, cloud, and living thing on the planet. Students investigate the driving question: Why doesn't Earth ever run out of water if we use billions of gallons every day? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

EVERY DROP YOU DRINK IS RECYCLED DINOSAUR WATER

The Never-Ending Journey of Water on Earth.
Why doesn't Earth ever run out of water if we use billions of gallons every day?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Solar Energy" — heat energy from the sun that drives evaporation from oceans
  ○ Click "Ground Temperature" — the temperature of earth's surface
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Evaporation Rate" — how quickly liquid water transforms into water vapor and enters the atmosphere
  ○ Click "Precipitation Rate" — how quickly water falls back to earth's surface as rain

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"Why doesn't Earth ever run out of water if we use billions of gallons every day?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Solar Energy' — that's external. Heat energy from the Sun that drives evaporation from oceans.
Click on 'Ground Temperature' — that's external. The temperature of Earth's surface.
Click on 'Evaporation Rate' — that's internal. How quickly liquid water transforms into water vapor and enters the atmosphere.
Click on 'Precipitation Rate' — that's internal. How quickly water falls back to Earth's surface as rain.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Solar Energy and Ground Temperature are external because they are environmental inputs to the water cycle that water itself cannot control. Evaporation Rate and Precipitation Rate are internal because they change as a direct result of how much energy and heat is available in the system.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Solar Energy" and drag an arrow to "Evaporation Rate"
• Click on "Ground Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Evaporation Rate"
• Click on "Evaporation Rate" and drag an arrow to "Precipitation Rate"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Solar Energy → Evaporation Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More solar energy provides more heat to break hydrogen bonds in liquid water, increasing the rate of evaporation from oceans, lakes, and soil.

  ○ Ground Temperature → Evaporation Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    Higher ground temperatures mean warmer surface water, which evaporates more quickly. Hot pavement after rain demonstrates this effect.

  ○ Evaporation Rate → Precipitation Rate = POSITIVE (+)
    More evaporation puts more water vapor into the atmosphere, which eventually condenses and falls as increased precipitation.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When solar energy increases dramatically (like during summer), what happens to the evaporation rate — and does more evaporation always mean more precipitation in the same area?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Solar Energy' and drag an arrow
over to 'Evaporation Rate.'

Here's the key question: When solar energy goes UP, does
evaporation rate go UP or DOWN?

More solar energy provides more heat to break hydrogen bonds in liquid water, increasing the rate of evaporation from oceans, lakes, and soil.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Ground Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Evaporation Rate.'

Here's the key question: When ground temperature goes UP, does
evaporation rate go UP or DOWN?

Higher ground temperatures mean warmer surface water, which evaporates more quickly. Hot pavement after rain demonstrates this effect.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Evaporation Rate' and drag an arrow
over to 'Precipitation Rate.'

Here's the key question: When evaporation rate goes UP, does
precipitation rate go UP or DOWN?

More evaporation puts more water vapor into the atmosphere, which eventually condenses and falls as increased precipitation.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When solar energy increases dramatically (like during summer), what happens to the evaporation rate — and does more evaporation always mean more precipitation in the same area?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Solar Energy is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — SUMMER HEAT WAVE
• Maximum solar energy and ground temperature
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Evaporation Rate during a heat wave?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — WINTER FREEZE
• Ground Temperature near freezing, reduced solar energy
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the water cycle when temperatures drop?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — NORMAL CONDITIONS
• Moderate solar energy and temperature
• PREDICT FIRST: How do you predict the water cycle maintains balance under normal conditions?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The Sun is the engine of the water cycle — without solar energy, water wouldn't evaporate
• Gravity pulls precipitation back to Earth and drives groundwater flow downhill
• The same water molecules have been cycling through Earth's systems for billions of years
• Temperature controls the SPEED of the cycle — hotter conditions accelerate it

THE ANSWER: Earth never runs out of water because it's continuously RECYCLED. Solar energy evaporates water from oceans and lakes, wind carries it as clouds, gravity pulls it back as rain, and it flows back to the ocean. The same water has been cycling for 4.5 billion years — every drop you drink was once a dinosaur's drink!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Summer Heat Wave. Maximum solar energy and ground temperature.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Winter Freeze.
Ground Temperature near freezing, reduced solar energy.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to the water cycle when temperatures drop?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Normal Conditions. Moderate solar energy and temperature.
How do you predict the water cycle maintains balance under normal conditions?

Here's what our model reveals: Earth never runs out of water because it's continuously RECYCLED. Solar energy evaporates water from oceans and lakes, wind carries it as clouds, gravity pulls it back as rain, and it flows back to the ocean. The same water has been cycling for 4.5 billion years — every drop you drink was once a dinosaur's drink!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Solar Energy?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Ground Temperature?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Wind Patterns — Wind carries water vapor from oceans to land, determining where precipitation falls
   • Plant Transpiration — Plants release water vapor through their leaves, adding significant moisture to the atmosphere
   • Human Water Use — Humans withdraw water from rivers, lakes, and aquifers, affecting how much is available for natural cycling

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • How the Water Cycle Works — how does this connect to your model?
   • Energy Drives the Cycle — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is the water cycle called a CYCLE and not a one-way process?
   • How does cutting down forests affect the water cycle in that region?
   • Why do some places get floods while nearby places have droughts at the same time?
   • What would happen to the water cycle if the Sun suddenly produced less energy?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Wind Patterns. Wind carries water vapor from oceans to land, determining where precipitation falls
How would you model that?

Plant Transpiration. Plants release water vapor through their leaves, adding significant moisture to the atmosphere
How would you model that?

Human Water Use. Humans withdraw water from rivers, lakes, and aquifers, affecting how much is available for natural cycling
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Every Drop You Drink Is Recycled Dinosaur Water
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Water is the most important substance on Earth for supporting life. The water cycle — driven by solar energy and gravity — has been recycling the same water molecules for over 4 billion years, connecting every ocean, river, cloud, and living thing on the planet.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS2-4: Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth's systems driven by energy from the Sun and the force of gravity.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model to describe the cycling of water through Earth's systems.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS2.C The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes
  Water continually cycles among land, ocean, and atmosphere via transpiration, evaporation, condensation, crystallization, and precipitation.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students trace the flow of energy (solar) and matter (water) through the water cycle system, showing that matter is conserved as it changes form.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Evaporation, Condensation, Transpiration, Watershed
□ Prepare Why doesn't Earth ever run out of water if we use billions of gallons every day discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify solar energy, ground temperature, evaporation rate, and precipitation rate as key components of the water cycle system.
• Establish: Students determine that solar energy and temperature positively drive evaporation, which positively drives precipitation.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how energy input controls the speed and volume of water cycling.
• Evaluate: Students run heat wave, winter, and normal scenarios to observe how temperature changes affect cycle rates.
• Revise: Students add wind patterns or transpiration to explore more complex water cycle dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• How the Water Cycle Works:
  Solar energy heats surface water in oceans, lakes, and soil, causing evaporation. Water vapor rises into the atmosphere, cools, and condenses into clouds. When droplets become heavy enough, gravity pulls them back to Earth as precipitation. Water then flows through rivers, soaks into groundwater, or is absorbed by plants — eventually returning to the ocean.

• Energy Drives the Cycle:
  The Sun provides the energy needed to break hydrogen bonds between water molecules during evaporation. About 86% of global evaporation occurs from ocean surfaces. The energy stored in water vapor is released as latent heat when condensation occurs, driving weather patterns and storms.

• Gravity's Role:
  Gravity is essential for precipitation — it pulls water droplets out of clouds. It also drives surface runoff (rivers flowing downhill), groundwater movement, and ocean circulation. Without gravity, water would float off into space as vapor.

• Water Reservoirs:
  Earth's water is stored in reservoirs: oceans (97.2%), ice caps and glaciers (2.1%), groundwater (0.6%), freshwater lakes and rivers (0.01%), and atmosphere (0.001%). The cycle moves water between these reservoirs continuously. A water molecule spends an average of 3,200 years in the ocean before evaporating.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "New water is constantly being created"
  Reality: Earth has had roughly the same amount of water for 4 billion years. No new water is being created — it's being RECYCLED endlessly. The water cycle moves water between reservoirs but doesn't create or destroy it.
  Strategy: Seal water in a jar and place in sunlight. The water evaporates and condenses on the glass, but the total amount never changes.

• "Clouds are made of water vapor"
  Reality: Clouds are made of tiny LIQUID water droplets or ice crystals — not water vapor. Water vapor is invisible gas. When we see a cloud, the vapor has already CONDENSED into visible droplets.
  Strategy: Breathe out on a cold day. The visible fog is condensed droplets, not the invisible vapor in your breath.

• "Rain comes from the ocean directly above"
  Reality: Rain can fall thousands of miles from where the water originally evaporated. Wind carries water vapor across continents before it condenses and falls. Water that evaporated from the Pacific Ocean can fall as rain in Kansas.
  Strategy: Show a weather map with storm tracks crossing the continent. Trace where the moisture originated.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why doesn't Earth ever run out of water if we use billions of gallons every day?
Answer: Earth never runs out of water because it's continuously RECYCLED. Solar energy evaporates water from oceans and lakes, wind carries it as clouds, gravity pulls it back as rain, and it flows back to the ocean. The same water has been cycling for 4.5 billion years — every drop you drink was once a dinosaur's drink!

Simulation Answers:
• Summer Heat Wave Scenario: When Solar Energy and Ground Temperature are maximized, Evaporation Rate increases dramatically. This puts much more water vapor into the atmosphere, which leads to increased Precipitation Rate. The cycle accelerates — more water moves through the system faster.
• Winter Freeze Scenario: When Ground Temperature drops near freezing, Evaporation Rate slows significantly because less energy is available to break water molecule bonds. Precipitation Rate also decreases, and what precipitation does occur often falls as snow, which can store water in frozen form for months.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is it called a cycle?
  A: Water continuously moves through the system in a loop: evaporation lifts it up, condensation forms clouds, precipitation brings it down, runoff carries it to the ocean, and the process starts again. No water is created or destroyed — it just changes form and location. It's been cycling for over 4 billion years.
• Q: How does deforestation affect the water cycle?
  A: Trees release water vapor through transpiration — a large tree can release over 100 gallons per day. Removing forests reduces this moisture source, which can decrease local rainfall. Deforested areas also have more surface runoff and erosion because tree roots no longer hold soil and slow water flow.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Water Purification System
Mission: Engineer a portable water purification system using your understanding of the water cycle — specifically evaporation and condensation — to make dirty water drinkable.
Scenario: After a natural disaster, clean water supplies are contaminated. Your engineering team must design a solar-powered water purification system using water cycle principles to provide clean drinking water.
Introduction: Present the disaster scenario: After a flood, clean water is contaminated. Your team must design a solar-powered purification system using evaporation and condensation principles from the water cycle.

Key Concepts:
• Solar Distillation: Using solar energy to evaporate contaminated water and collecting the pure condensation — contaminants are left behind because they don't evaporate with the water.
• Phase Changes: Water changes state between solid, liquid, and gas. Contaminants typically stay behind during evaporation because they have different boiling points.
• Water Quality: Clean water is essential for human health. Contaminated water can contain bacteria, chemicals, and sediment that cause disease. Purification removes these contaminants.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): System successfully demonstrates evaporation-condensation purification, collects measurable clean water, and student explains water cycle connection
• Proficient (3): System demonstrates the purification concept and student can explain how it connects to the water cycle
• Developing (2): System is built but doesn't effectively separate contaminants or collect clean water
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or student can't explain the water cycle connection

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a labeled water cycle diagram showing all phases and processes
  • Use a sealed terrarium to visually demonstrate evaporation, condensation, and precipitation
  • Sentence frames: 'When solar energy increases, evaporation __ because __, which causes precipitation to __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how much water plants release through transpiration and add it to the model
  • Calculate how long a water molecule spends in different reservoirs (ocean vs. atmosphere vs. glacier)
  • Investigate how urbanization (concrete and asphalt) affects local water cycling and groundwater recharge

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the percentage of Earth's water in each reservoir and create a proportional chart
  • ELA: Write a creative story from the perspective of a water molecule traveling through the complete cycle
  • Social Studies: Research water scarcity around the world and how the water cycle creates inequity in water access

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Describe how solar energy and gravity drive the water cycle
• Model the cycling of water through Earth's atmosphere, surface, and underground systems
• Explain how changes in one part of the water cycle affect other parts

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: During a heat wave, evaporation rates from a lake increase significantly. Which of the following is the most likely effect on the local water cycle?
• Constructed Response: Develop and describe a model showing how water cycles through Earth's systems. Explain the role of solar energy and gravity in driving this cycle.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Water Purification System
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Engineer a portable water purification system using your understanding of the water cycle — specifically evaporation and condensation — to make dirty water drinkable.

SCENARIO: After a natural disaster, clean water supplies are contaminated. Your engineering team must design a solar-powered water purification system using water cycle principles to provide clean drinking water.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How can you use evaporation and condensation to separate clean water from contaminants?
• What role does solar energy play in your purification system?
• How would you scale your design to produce enough water for a family?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How will you use solar energy to evaporate contaminated water?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you capture and condense the water vapor?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you collect the purified water?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you test whether your purified water is actually clean?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): System successfully demonstrates evaporation-condensation purification, collects measurable clean water, and student explains water cycle connection
• Proficient (3): System demonstrates the purification concept and student can explain how it connects to the water cycle
• Developing (2): System is built but doesn't effectively separate contaminants or collect clean water
• Beginning (1): System is incomplete or student can't explain the water cycle connection
