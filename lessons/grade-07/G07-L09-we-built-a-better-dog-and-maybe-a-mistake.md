### Title
**We Built a Better Dog (And Maybe a Mistake) — How Humans Hack Evolution Through Selective Breeding**

### Overview
Humans have been modifying organisms through selective breeding for over 10,000 years — long before we understood genetics. From wolves to dogs, from wild grass to corn, artificial selection has shaped the living world to meet human needs. Students investigate the driving question: How have humans changed plants and animals to suit our needs — and at what cost? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

WE BUILT A BETTER DOG (AND MAYBE A MISTAKE)

How Humans Hack Evolution Through Selective Breeding.
How have humans changed plants and animals to suit our needs — and at what cost?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Selection Pressure" — how strongly humans select for a specific trait — from mild preference to extreme breeding programs
  ○ Click "Generation Time" — how quickly organisms reproduce and create new generations — faster means faster change
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Desired Trait Frequency" — how common the trait we want becomes in the population over time
  ○ Click "Genetic Diversity" — the overall variety of genes in the population — drops when selection is too narrow

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

"How have humans changed plants and animals to suit our needs — and at what cost?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Selection Pressure' — that's external. How strongly humans select for a specific trait — from mild preference to extreme breeding programs.
Click on 'Generation Time' — that's external. How quickly organisms reproduce and create new generations — faster means faster change.
Click on 'Desired Trait Frequency' — that's internal. How common the trait we want becomes in the population over time.
Click on 'Genetic Diversity' — that's internal. The overall variety of genes in the population — drops when selection is too narrow.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Selection Pressure and Generation Time are external because they are controlled by humans — we decide how strongly to select and how quickly we breed organisms. Desired Trait Frequency and Genetic Diversity are internal because they are outcomes that change as a result of the selection process over time.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Selection Pressure" and drag an arrow to "Desired Trait Frequency"
• Click on "Generation Time" and drag an arrow to "Desired Trait Frequency"
• Click on "Selection Pressure" and drag an arrow to "Genetic Diversity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Selection Pressure → Desired Trait Frequency = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger selection pressure means only organisms with the desired trait reproduce, rapidly increasing how common that trait is in the population.

  ○ Generation Time → Desired Trait Frequency = POSITIVE (+)
    More generations of selection allow the desired trait to become more common. Faster-reproducing organisms show results sooner.

  ○ Selection Pressure → Genetic Diversity = NEGATIVE (−)
    Strong selection eliminates individuals without the desired trait, reducing the gene pool. Extreme selection dramatically narrows genetic diversity, making populations vulnerable.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When selection pressure is extreme (like breeding only the flattest-faced bulldogs), desired trait frequency goes up — but what happens to genetic diversity? Is there a hidden cost?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Selection Pressure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Desired Trait Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When selection pressure goes UP, does
desired trait frequency go UP or DOWN?

Stronger selection pressure means only organisms with the desired trait reproduce, rapidly increasing how common that trait is in the population.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Generation Time' and drag an arrow
over to 'Desired Trait Frequency.'

Here's the key question: When generation time goes UP, does
desired trait frequency go UP or DOWN?

More generations of selection allow the desired trait to become more common. Faster-reproducing organisms show results sooner.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Selection Pressure' and drag an arrow
over to 'Genetic Diversity.'

Here's the key question: When selection pressure goes UP, does
genetic diversity go UP or DOWN?

Strong selection eliminates individuals without the desired trait, reducing the gene pool. Extreme selection dramatically narrows genetic diversity, making populations vulnerable.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When selection pressure is extreme (like breeding only the flattest-faced bulldogs), desired trait frequency goes up — but what happens to genetic diversity? Is there a hidden cost?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Selection Pressure is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — MILD SELECTION
• Low selection pressure over many generations
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Desired Trait Frequency with gentle selection over a long time?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — EXTREME PUREBRED
• Maximum selection pressure, fast generations
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Genetic Diversity when only a few 'perfect' individuals are allowed to breed?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — WILD POPULATION
• No selection pressure
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict Genetic Diversity looks like when humans don't interfere at all?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Artificial selection works the same as natural selection, but humans choose the 'fittest' traits instead of nature
• Extreme selection increases desired traits but DECREASES genetic diversity — making populations vulnerable
• Many purebred dogs suffer health problems directly caused by selective breeding for appearance
• All domestic dogs evolved from wolves through thousands of years of human-directed selection

THE ANSWER: Humans change organisms through selective breeding — choosing individuals with desired traits to reproduce generation after generation. It works, but there's a hidden cost: extreme selection reduces genetic diversity, making populations vulnerable to disease and creating health problems. Purebred bulldogs can barely breathe because we bred them for flat faces!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Mild Selection. Low selection pressure over many generations.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Extreme Purebred.
Maximum selection pressure, fast generations.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Genetic Diversity when only a few 'perfect' individuals are allowed to breed?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Wild Population. No selection pressure.
What do you predict Genetic Diversity looks like when humans don't interfere at all?

Here's what our model reveals: Humans change organisms through selective breeding — choosing individuals with desired traits to reproduce generation after generation. It works, but there's a hidden cost: extreme selection reduces genetic diversity, making populations vulnerable to disease and creating health problems. Purebred bulldogs can barely breathe because we bred them for flat faces!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Selection Pressure?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Generation Time?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Inbreeding Depression — When closely related organisms breed, harmful recessive genes become more common, causing health problems
   • GMO Technology — Genetic modification directly edits DNA to insert desired traits, bypassing the slow process of selective breeding
   • Wild Genetic Reservoir — Wild populations contain genetic diversity that can be crossbred with domesticated populations to restore health

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • From Wolves to Dogs — how does this connect to your model?
   • Artificial vs. Natural Selection — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • How is artificial selection similar to and different from natural selection?
   • Why do many purebred dogs have more health problems than mixed-breed dogs?
   • Is it ethical to breed animals for traits that make them unhealthy but look cute to humans?
   • How has selective breeding of crops like corn and wheat changed human civilization?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Inbreeding Depression. When closely related organisms breed, harmful recessive genes become more common, causing health problems
How would you model that?

GMO Technology. Genetic modification directly edits DNA to insert desired traits, bypassing the slow process of selective breeding
How would you model that?

Wild Genetic Reservoir. Wild populations contain genetic diversity that can be crossbred with domesticated populations to restore health
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: We Built a Better Dog (And Maybe a Mistake)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Humans have been modifying organisms through selective breeding for over 10,000 years — long before we understood genetics. From wolves to dogs, from wild grass to corn, artificial selection has shaped the living world to meet human needs.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS4-5: Gather and synthesize information about technologies that have changed the way humans influence the inheritance of desired traits in organisms.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information
  Students gather and synthesize information about how technologies like selective breeding and genetic modification change inheritance of traits.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS4.B Natural Selection and Artificial Selection
  In artificial selection, humans have the capacity to influence certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify that human selection pressure CAUSES changes in trait frequency, with both intended effects (desired traits) and unintended consequences (reduced diversity).

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Selective Breeding, Artificial Selection, Genetic Variation, Trait Frequency
□ Prepare How have humans changed plants and animals to suit our needs — and at what cost discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify selection pressure, generation time, desired trait frequency, and genetic diversity as components of the selective breeding system.
• Establish: Students determine that selection pressure increases desired traits but decreases overall genetic diversity — revealing the trade-off.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how human selection changes populations over generations.
• Evaluate: Students run mild, extreme, and no-selection scenarios to compare evolutionary outcomes.
• Revise: Students add inbreeding depression or GMO technology to explore more complex breeding dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• From Wolves to Dogs:
  All domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) descended from wolves through at least 15,000 years of selective breeding. Early humans selected wolves that were less aggressive and more cooperative. Over centuries, specialized breeding created everything from tiny Chihuahuas to massive Great Danes — all from the same ancestor.

• Artificial vs. Natural Selection:
  Both processes work through the same mechanism: variation exists, some individuals reproduce more than others, traits are inherited. The difference is WHO selects. In natural selection, the environment determines fitness. In artificial selection, HUMANS choose which traits to favor — often for our benefit rather than the organism's.

• The Cost of Extreme Breeding:
  Extreme selective breeding reduces genetic diversity, causing problems. Purebred English Bulldogs have such flat faces they can barely breathe. German Shepherds have sloped backs causing hip dysplasia. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels often have skulls too small for their brains. These are direct consequences of breeding for appearance over health.

• Modern Genetic Technologies:
  Today, selective breeding has been supplemented by genetic modification (GMOs), gene editing (CRISPR), and cloning. These technologies can achieve in one generation what would take decades of selective breeding. They raise important ethical questions about how far humans should go in modifying other organisms.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Selective breeding is the same as genetic modification"
  Reality: Selective breeding uses natural reproduction — choosing which organisms mate based on their traits. Genetic modification directly alters DNA in a lab. Selective breeding has been done for 10,000+ years; GMOs are a modern technology. Both change organisms, but through very different methods.
  Strategy: Analogy: Selective breeding is like choosing which songs to play on a playlist. GMO is like remixing the songs in a studio.

• "Artificial selection is unnatural"
  Reality: Humans have been selectively breeding organisms for over 10,000 years — longer than recorded history. Every fruit, vegetable, and domestic animal has been modified by humans. The 'natural' versions of corn, bananas, and watermelon look nothing like what we eat today.
  Strategy: Show images of wild banana (tiny, full of seeds) vs. modern banana. Wild corn (teosinte) vs. sweet corn. We changed these.

• "More selection is always better"
  Reality: Extreme selection creates a dangerous trade-off. While the desired trait increases, genetic diversity crashes. Low diversity makes populations vulnerable to disease epidemics, environmental changes, and inherited disorders. The Irish Potato Famine killed over a million people because all the potatoes were genetically identical.
  Strategy: Show the bulldog breathing problem. Ask: We got the flat face we wanted. Was it worth this cost?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How have humans changed plants and animals to suit our needs — and at what cost?
Answer: Humans change organisms through selective breeding — choosing individuals with desired traits to reproduce generation after generation. It works, but there's a hidden cost: extreme selection reduces genetic diversity, making populations vulnerable to disease and creating health problems. Purebred bulldogs can barely breathe because we bred them for flat faces!

Simulation Answers:
• Extreme Purebred Scenario: When Selection Pressure is maximized, Desired Trait Frequency rises rapidly — the trait becomes nearly universal within a few generations. But Genetic Diversity crashes. With fewer genetic variants, the population becomes vulnerable to diseases, environmental changes, and inherited health problems.
• Wild Population Scenario: With no Selection Pressure, Desired Trait Frequency stays at natural levels (no change in any specific direction). Genetic Diversity remains high — the population has maximum variation, making it resilient and adaptable to environmental challenges.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: How is artificial selection like natural selection?
  A: Both work through the same mechanism: (1) Variation exists in the population, (2) Some individuals reproduce more, (3) Traits are inherited by offspring. The only difference is WHO decides which traits are 'fit.' In natural selection, the environment decides. In artificial selection, humans decide.
• Q: Why do purebred dogs have more health problems?
  A: Extreme selective breeding dramatically reduces genetic diversity. When only dogs with specific appearance traits are allowed to breed (generation after generation), harmful recessive genes become concentrated. English Bulldogs were bred for flat faces, creating breathing problems. German Shepherds were bred for sloped backs, causing hip dysplasia. The 'desired' appearance comes at the cost of health.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Responsible Breeding Program
Mission: Design an ethical, evidence-based crop improvement program that increases yield while maintaining genetic diversity, using your understanding of artificial selection.
Scenario: A farming community is losing crop harvests to a new pest. They need your team to design a selective breeding program that develops pest-resistant crops WITHOUT sacrificing genetic diversity.
Introduction: A farming community needs pest-resistant crops but is concerned about losing genetic diversity. Your team must design a breeding program that achieves resistance while maintaining a healthy gene pool.

Key Concepts:
• Gene Pool: The total collection of genes in a breeding population. A larger gene pool means more genetic diversity and greater resilience against diseases and environmental changes.
• Hybrid Vigor: Crossing genetically different individuals often produces offspring that are healthier and more robust than either parent. This is the opposite of the problems caused by inbreeding.
• Seed Banks: Facilities like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault store seeds from thousands of crop varieties, preserving genetic diversity as insurance against crop failures and extinction.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Program balances trait selection with diversity maintenance, references model evidence, includes monitoring plan, and addresses ethical considerations
• Proficient (3): Program selects for desired traits while acknowledging diversity concerns, with model evidence
• Developing (2): Program focuses on trait selection but doesn't adequately address genetic diversity
• Beginning (1): Program is incomplete or doesn't connect to artificial selection concepts

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide visual charts showing dog breed changes over 100 years for concrete examples
  • Use colored beads to physically simulate selection pressure on a 'population'
  • Sentence frames: 'When selection pressure increases, desired trait frequency __ but genetic diversity __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research CRISPR gene editing and compare its speed and precision to traditional selective breeding
  • Investigate the Irish Potato Famine as a case study of what happens when genetic diversity is too low
  • Debate: Should we use genetic modification to create 'designer babies'?

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate how many generations of selection it takes for a rare trait to become dominant in a population
  • ELA: Write a persuasive essay arguing for or against extreme selective breeding in dog shows
  • Social Studies: Research how the agricultural revolution (10,000 years of selective breeding) led to civilization

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how artificial selection changes trait frequencies in populations over generations
• Compare natural selection and artificial selection
• Evaluate technologies that influence inheritance of traits

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Over 15,000 years, humans selectively bred wolves into hundreds of dog breeds. Which statement best explains why all dog breeds can still interbreed with wolves?
• Constructed Response: Explain how selective breeding can both improve a desired trait AND create unintended health problems. Use a specific example in your answer.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Responsible Breeding Program
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design an ethical, evidence-based crop improvement program that increases yield while maintaining genetic diversity, using your understanding of artificial selection.

SCENARIO: A farming community is losing crop harvests to a new pest. They need your team to design a selective breeding program that develops pest-resistant crops WITHOUT sacrificing genetic diversity.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How can you select for pest resistance without reducing genetic diversity too much?
• What's the difference between selective breeding and genetic modification (GMO)?
• What safeguards should be in place to prevent unintended consequences?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What trait are you selecting for and how will you identify it?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you maintain genetic diversity while selecting for your desired trait?

  _________________________________________________________

• How many generations will your program need to see results?

  _________________________________________________________

• What are the potential risks of your breeding program?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Program balances trait selection with diversity maintenance, references model evidence, includes monitoring plan, and addresses ethical considerations
• Proficient (3): Program selects for desired traits while acknowledging diversity concerns, with model evidence
• Developing (2): Program focuses on trait selection but doesn't adequately address genetic diversity
• Beginning (1): Program is incomplete or doesn't connect to artificial selection concepts
