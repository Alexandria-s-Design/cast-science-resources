### Title
**Earth Has a Fever — Why 2 Degrees Could Change Everything**

### Overview
Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century. Understanding the science behind it — greenhouse gases, feedback loops, and cascading effects — is essential for making informed decisions about our planet's future. Students investigate the driving question: If Earth's temperature rises by just 2 degrees Celsius, why could it change everything? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

EARTH HAS A FEVER

Why 2 Degrees Could Change Everything.
If Earth's temperature rises by just 2 degrees Celsius, why could it change everything?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "CO2 Concentration" — the amount of carbon dioxide in earth's atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and deforestation
  ○ Click "Solar Energy Input" — the amount of energy earth receives from the sun
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Average Global Temperature" — the mean surface temperature of the entire planet
  ○ Click "Ice Sheet Coverage" — the total area of earth covered by glaciers and polar ice caps

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"If Earth's temperature rises by just 2 degrees Celsius, why could it change everything?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'CO2 Concentration' — that's external. The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
Click on 'Solar Energy Input' — that's external. The amount of energy Earth receives from the Sun.
Click on 'Average Global Temperature' — that's internal. The mean surface temperature of the entire planet.
Click on 'Ice Sheet Coverage' — that's internal. The total area of Earth covered by glaciers and polar ice caps.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

CO2 Concentration and Solar Energy Input are external because they are inputs to the climate system — CO2 comes from human activities and natural sources, while solar energy comes from the Sun. Average Global Temperature and Ice Sheet Coverage are internal because they change as a result of those external energy inputs.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "CO2 Concentration" and drag an arrow to "Average Global Temperature"
• Click on "Solar Energy Input" and drag an arrow to "Average Global Temperature"
• Click on "Average Global Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Ice Sheet Coverage"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ CO2 Concentration → Average Global Temperature = POSITIVE (+)
    More CO2 in the atmosphere traps more heat through the greenhouse effect, causing average temperatures to rise.

  ○ Solar Energy Input → Average Global Temperature = POSITIVE (+)
    More solar energy hitting Earth's surface increases the amount of heat available, raising temperatures.

  ○ Average Global Temperature → Ice Sheet Coverage = NEGATIVE (−)
    As global temperatures rise, ice sheets and glaciers melt, reducing the total area of Earth covered by ice.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When CO2 concentration increases, global temperature rises. But what happens to ice sheets when temperature rises — and does melting ice create a feedback loop?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'CO2 Concentration' and drag an arrow
over to 'Average Global Temperature.'

Here's the key question: When co2 concentration goes UP, does
average global temperature go UP or DOWN?

More CO2 in the atmosphere traps more heat through the greenhouse effect, causing average temperatures to rise.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Solar Energy Input' and drag an arrow
over to 'Average Global Temperature.'

Here's the key question: When solar energy input goes UP, does
average global temperature go UP or DOWN?

More solar energy hitting Earth's surface increases the amount of heat available, raising temperatures.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Average Global Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Ice Sheet Coverage.'

Here's the key question: When average global temperature goes UP, does
ice sheet coverage go UP or DOWN?

As global temperatures rise, ice sheets and glaciers melt, reducing the total area of Earth covered by ice.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When CO2 concentration increases, global temperature rises. But what happens to ice sheets when temperature rises — and does melting ice create a feedback loop?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When CO2 Concentration is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — PRE-INDUSTRIAL
• CO2 at low historical levels, stable solar input
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Ice Sheet Coverage when CO2 is at pre-industrial levels?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — CURRENT TRAJECTORY
• CO2 locked at high and rising levels
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Average Global Temperature and Ice Sheet Coverage if CO2 keeps rising?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — EMISSION REDUCTION
• CO2 reduced to moderate levels
• PREDICT FIRST: How much difference do you predict emission reduction makes compared to the current trajectory?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• CO2 acts like a blanket — more CO2 traps more heat, raising global temperature
• Rising temperatures melt ice sheets, which reduces Earth's reflectivity and causes MORE warming (positive feedback)
• Even 2°C of warming dramatically changes weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems
• Human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 by over 50% since the Industrial Revolution

THE ANSWER: Even 2°C of warming matters enormously because Earth's climate system has feedback loops. Rising CO2 traps heat, which melts ice, which exposes dark ocean that absorbs MORE heat, causing MORE melting. Small temperature changes cascade into massive effects on sea level, weather, and ecosystems!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Pre-Industrial. CO2 at low historical levels, stable solar input.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Current Trajectory.
CO2 locked at high and rising levels.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Average Global Temperature and Ice Sheet Coverage if CO2 keeps rising?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Emission Reduction. CO2 reduced to moderate levels.
How much difference do you predict emission reduction makes compared to the current trajectory?

Here's what our model reveals: Even 2°C of warming matters enormously because Earth's climate system has feedback loops. Rising CO2 traps heat, which melts ice, which exposes dark ocean that absorbs MORE heat, causing MORE melting. Small temperature changes cascade into massive effects on sea level, weather, and ecosystems!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF CO2 Concentration?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Solar Energy Input?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Methane Emissions — Methane is a greenhouse gas 80x more potent than CO2, released by livestock, landfills, and permafrost
   • Ocean Absorption — Oceans absorb about 30% of CO2 from the atmosphere, but this makes them more acidic
   • Albedo Effect — The reflectivity of Earth's surface — ice reflects sunlight while dark ocean absorbs it

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Greenhouse Effect — how does this connect to your model?
   • CO2 and Temperature — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is a 2°C rise in global temperature considered dangerous when daily temperatures vary by much more?
   • How does the melting of ice sheets create a positive feedback loop that accelerates warming?
   • What evidence from the last 100 years shows that human activity is driving climate change?
   • How does your model help you understand why some people say climate change is 'accelerating'?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Methane Emissions. Methane is a greenhouse gas 80x more potent than CO2, released by livestock, landfills, and permafrost
How would you model that?

Ocean Absorption. Oceans absorb about 30% of CO2 from the atmosphere, but this makes them more acidic
How would you model that?

Albedo Effect. The reflectivity of Earth's surface — ice reflects sunlight while dark ocean absorbs it
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Earth Has a Fever
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century. Understanding the science behind it — greenhouse gases, feedback loops, and cascading effects — is essential for making informed decisions about our planet's future.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS3-5: Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Asking Questions and Defining Problems
  Students ask questions to clarify evidence about factors causing global temperature rises.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS3.D Global Climate Change
  Human activities have significantly altered the biosphere, sometimes damaging or destroying natural habitats and causing extinction of species.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students analyze how small changes in CO2 concentration create large, cascading changes in global climate systems.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Greenhouse Effect, Carbon Footprint, Thermal Expansion, Feedback Loop
□ Prepare If Earth's temperature rises by just 2 degrees Celsius, why could it change everything discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify CO2 concentration, solar energy, global temperature, and ice sheet coverage as key components of the climate system.
• Establish: Students determine that CO2 positively affects temperature, which negatively affects ice coverage, creating a cascade of effects.
• Visualize: Students build a climate model showing how greenhouse gas increases drive temperature and ice changes.
• Evaluate: Students run pre-industrial, current trajectory, and emission reduction scenarios to compare outcomes.
• Revise: Students add methane emissions or albedo effect to explore feedback loops in the climate system.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Greenhouse Effect:
  Certain gases in Earth's atmosphere (CO2, methane, water vapor) allow sunlight to pass through but trap heat radiating back from Earth's surface. This natural greenhouse effect keeps Earth habitable — without it, average temperature would be -18°C. The problem is that human activities are dramatically increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.

• CO2 and Temperature:
  Atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm (pre-industrial) to over 420 ppm today — a 50% increase. Ice core data shows that CO2 and temperature have moved together for 800,000 years. The current rate of CO2 increase is unprecedented in the geological record.

• Feedback Loops:
  Climate change involves powerful feedback loops. As temperatures rise, ice melts, exposing dark ocean and land that absorb MORE heat (ice-albedo feedback). Warming permafrost releases stored methane, causing MORE warming. These positive feedbacks can accelerate change beyond what CO2 alone would cause.

• Impacts of 2°C Warming:
  At 2°C above pre-industrial levels: sea levels could rise 0.5m+ (flooding coastal cities), extreme weather events become more frequent, coral reefs face mass extinction, agricultural zones shift, and water scarcity affects billions. The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is enormous in terms of human impact.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Weather and climate are the same thing"
  Reality: Weather is short-term, local conditions (today's temperature). Climate is long-term, global patterns (average temperature over decades). A cold day doesn't disprove climate change — it's the long-term TREND that matters.
  Strategy: Show a graph of daily temperatures (noisy) vs. the 30-year average trend (clearly rising). Ask: Which tells the real story?

• "The greenhouse effect is bad"
  Reality: The NATURAL greenhouse effect is essential — without it, Earth would be frozen. The problem is that humans have ENHANCED it by adding excess CO2, trapping more heat than the system can handle.
  Strategy: Ask: Is a blanket bad? No — but if you pile on 10 blankets in summer, you'll overheat. Same concept.

• "Scientists disagree about climate change"
  Reality: Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing global warming. The scientific consensus is overwhelming. Disagreement exists about exact timelines and solutions, not about whether it's happening.
  Strategy: Show the 97% statistic visually. Compare to: 97% of doctors agree smoking causes cancer — would you argue?

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: If Earth's temperature rises by just 2 degrees Celsius, why could it change everything?
Answer: Even 2°C of warming matters enormously because Earth's climate system has feedback loops. Rising CO2 traps heat, which melts ice, which exposes dark ocean that absorbs MORE heat, causing MORE melting. Small temperature changes cascade into massive effects on sea level, weather, and ecosystems!

Simulation Answers:
• Current Trajectory Scenario: When CO2 Concentration is locked at high levels, Average Global Temperature rises steadily. Ice Sheet Coverage decreases as temperatures climb. The model shows that sustained high CO2 leads to continuous warming and ice loss — matching real-world observations.
• Emission Reduction Scenario: When CO2 is reduced to moderate levels, temperature still rises but much more slowly. Ice Sheet Coverage decreases less dramatically. The key insight: even reduced emissions don't immediately reverse warming, but they significantly slow the rate of change.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is 2°C dangerous if daily temps vary more?
  A: Daily temperature variations are LOCAL and TEMPORARY. A 2°C rise in AVERAGE GLOBAL temperature means the entire planet — every ocean, every continent, every ecosystem — is warmer all the time. It shifts weather patterns, melts ice caps permanently, raises sea levels globally, and disrupts ecosystems that evolved for specific temperature ranges.
• Q: How does ice melting create a feedback loop?
  A: Ice is white and reflects sunlight (high albedo). When ice melts, it exposes dark ocean water that ABSORBS heat instead. This absorbed heat raises temperatures further, melting MORE ice, exposing MORE dark water, absorbing MORE heat. The original warming AMPLIFIES itself — that's a positive feedback loop.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a School Climate Action Plan
Mission: Create an evidence-based climate action plan for your school that reduces carbon emissions and educates the community, using data from your model.
Scenario: Your school district wants to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% in 10 years. The superintendent needs your team to propose specific actions with evidence showing they'll work.
Introduction: Your school district wants to cut carbon emissions by 50% in 10 years. The superintendent needs evidence-based recommendations. Use your climate model data to propose specific, measurable actions.

Key Concepts:
• Carbon Budget: The total amount of CO2 that can still be emitted while keeping warming below a target. At current rates, the 1.5°C budget may be exhausted within a decade.
• Mitigation vs. Adaptation: Mitigation means reducing emissions to slow warming. Adaptation means preparing for changes that are already inevitable. Effective climate policy requires both.
• Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power produce electricity without burning fossil fuels, dramatically reducing CO2 emissions compared to coal, oil, and natural gas.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan includes specific emission reduction targets, references model evidence, addresses multiple strategies, and includes a measurement system
• Proficient (3): Plan references climate model data and includes at least two specific reduction strategies
• Developing (2): Plan mentions climate change but lacks specific evidence or measurable targets
• Beginning (1): Plan doesn't connect to model findings or lacks actionable strategies

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a simplified CO2 vs. temperature graph for reference during model building
  • Use ice cubes under a lamp to physically demonstrate the ice-albedo feedback loop
  • Sentence frames: 'When CO2 increases, temperature __ because __, which causes ice to __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the ice-albedo feedback loop and add it as a component to the model
  • Analyze real NASA temperature data and compare trends to model predictions
  • Calculate your personal carbon footprint and design a reduction strategy

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph CO2 concentration vs. temperature data from the last 200 years and calculate the rate of change
  • ELA: Write a persuasive letter to a local politician using your model evidence to argue for climate action
  • Social Studies: Research how climate change disproportionately affects developing nations and discuss climate justice

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Identify evidence that human activities have increased greenhouse gas concentrations
• Explain the relationship between CO2 concentration and global temperature
• Evaluate the potential impacts of different levels of global warming

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Since 1850, atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to over 420 ppm. During the same period, average global temperature has risen about 1.1°C. Which statement best explains this relationship?
• Constructed Response: Using evidence from your climate model, explain why scientists are concerned about a 2°C rise in global temperature. Include at least one feedback loop in your explanation.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a School Climate Action Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Create an evidence-based climate action plan for your school that reduces carbon emissions and educates the community, using data from your model.

SCENARIO: Your school district wants to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% in 10 years. The superintendent needs your team to propose specific actions with evidence showing they'll work.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which actions would reduce your school's carbon footprint the most?
• How can you use your model to show the impact of different reduction strategies?
• What role can students play in fighting climate change at the local level?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What are the biggest sources of CO2 emissions at your school?

  _________________________________________________________

• Which reduction strategies are most practical and cost-effective?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you educate other students about climate science?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure whether your plan is working?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan includes specific emission reduction targets, references model evidence, addresses multiple strategies, and includes a measurement system
• Proficient (3): Plan references climate model data and includes at least two specific reduction strategies
• Developing (2): Plan mentions climate change but lacks specific evidence or measurable targets
• Beginning (1): Plan doesn't connect to model findings or lacks actionable strategies
