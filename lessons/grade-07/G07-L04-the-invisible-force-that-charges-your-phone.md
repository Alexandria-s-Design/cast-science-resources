### Title
**The Invisible Force That Charges Your Phone — How Electricity and Magnetism Shape Our World**

### Overview
Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and the foundation of modern technology. Every electric motor, generator, speaker, and MRI machine relies on the connection between electricity and magnetism discovered in the 1800s. Students investigate the driving question: How can a force you can't see, smell, or touch move objects and transfer energy? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

### Grade
7th

### NGSS Standard
**MS-PS2-3, MS-PS2-5**: Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces. Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to provide evidence that fields exist between objects exerting forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain how electric current flowing through a wire creates a magnetic field
- Model the factors that affect electromagnet strength — current, coils, and core material
- Predict how changing variables affects the strength of an electromagnetic force
- Design experiments to test how invisible fields exert real forces on objects

### Component List (Starting Model: 3-4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Electric Current | External | The amount of electricity flowing through the wire, controlled by a power source |
| Number of Coil Wraps | External | How many times the wire is wrapped around the metal core |
| Magnetic Field Strength | Internal | How strong the invisible magnetic force is around the electromagnet |

THE INVISIBLE FORCE THAT CHARGES YOUR PHONE

How Electricity and Magnetism Shape Our World.
How can a force you can't see, smell, or touch move objects and transfer energy?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Electric Current" — the amount of electricity flowing through the wire
  ○ Click "Number of Coil Wraps" — how many times the wire is wrapped around the metal core
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Magnetic Field Strength" — how strong the invisible magnetic force is around the electromagnet
  ○ Click "Lifting Capacity" — how much weight the electromagnet can pick up and hold against gravity

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"How can a force you can't see, smell, or touch move objects and transfer energy?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Electric Current' — that's external. The amount of electricity flowing through the wire.
Click on 'Number of Coil Wraps' — that's external. How many times the wire is wrapped around the metal core.
Click on 'Magnetic Field Strength' — that's internal. How strong the invisible magnetic force is around the electromagnet.
Click on 'Lifting Capacity' — that's internal. How much weight the electromagnet can pick up and hold against gravity.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Electric Current and Number of Coil Wraps are external because they are design inputs that engineers control — you choose how much current to send and how many times to wrap the wire. Magnetic Field Strength and Lifting Capacity are internal because they are outputs that change as a result of those design choices.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Electric Current" and drag an arrow to "Magnetic Field Strength"
• Click on "Number of Coil Wraps" and drag an arrow to "Magnetic Field Strength"
• Click on "Magnetic Field Strength" and drag an arrow to "Lifting Capacity"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Electric Current → Magnetic Field Strength = POSITIVE (+)
    More electric current flowing through the wire creates a stronger magnetic field around the coil. More moving charges means more magnetic force.

  ○ Number of Coil Wraps → Magnetic Field Strength = POSITIVE (+)
    Each additional wrap of wire adds its magnetic field to the total. More coils concentrate and amplify the field.

  ○ Magnetic Field Strength → Lifting Capacity = POSITIVE (+)
    A stronger magnetic field exerts more force on magnetic objects, allowing the electromagnet to pick up and hold more weight.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When you increase both the electric current AND the number of coil wraps, what do you predict happens to the magnetic field strength? Is it additive or multiplicative?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Electric Current' and drag an arrow
over to 'Magnetic Field Strength.'

Here's the key question: When electric current goes UP, does
magnetic field strength go UP or DOWN?

More electric current flowing through the wire creates a stronger magnetic field around the coil. More moving charges means more magnetic force.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Number of Coil Wraps' and drag an arrow
over to 'Magnetic Field Strength.'

Here's the key question: When number of coil wraps goes UP, does
magnetic field strength go UP or DOWN?

Each additional wrap of wire adds its magnetic field to the total. More coils concentrate and amplify the field.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Magnetic Field Strength' and drag an arrow
over to 'Lifting Capacity.'

Here's the key question: When magnetic field strength goes UP, does
lifting capacity go UP or DOWN?

A stronger magnetic field exerts more force on magnetic objects, allowing the electromagnet to pick up and hold more weight.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When you increase both the electric current AND the number of coil wraps, what do you predict happens to the magnetic field strength? Is it additive or multiplicative?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Electric Current is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — LOW POWER
• Low current, few coils
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict the Lifting Capacity will be with a weak electromagnet?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — MAXIMUM COILS
• Many coils, moderate current
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Magnetic Field Strength when you add more coils?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — FULL POWER
• Maximum current AND maximum coils
• PREDICT FIRST: How do you predict the combined effect compares to changing just one variable?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Electric current creates a magnetic field around a wire — electricity and magnetism are connected
• More coil wraps concentrate the magnetic field, making the electromagnet stronger
• Increasing current increases the force — more electrons flowing means a stronger field
• Electromagnets can be turned on and off, unlike permanent magnets — this makes them incredibly useful

THE ANSWER: Invisible electromagnetic forces work because moving electric charges (current) create magnetic fields around them. By wrapping wire into coils and increasing current, we concentrate this invisible force into something strong enough to lift cars in junkyards — all from a force you can't see!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Low Power. Low current, few coils.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Maximum Coils.
Many coils, moderate current.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Magnetic Field Strength when you add more coils?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Full Power. Maximum current AND maximum coils.
How do you predict the combined effect compares to changing just one variable?

Here's what our model reveals: Invisible electromagnetic forces work because moving electric charges (current) create magnetic fields around them. By wrapping wire into coils and increasing current, we concentrate this invisible force into something strong enough to lift cars in junkyards — all from a force you can't see!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Electric Current?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Number of Coil Wraps?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Core Material — The type of metal inside the coil — iron cores concentrate magnetic fields better than air
   • Distance from Object — Magnetic force decreases rapidly with distance — the closer the object, the stronger the pull
   • Temperature — Heating a magnet weakens it because thermal energy disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Electricity Creates Magnetism — how does this connect to your model?
   • How Electromagnets Work — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why are electromagnets more useful than permanent magnets in many applications?
   • How does your phone use electromagnetic forces every day?
   • What would happen to our technology if we couldn't create magnetic fields with electricity?
   • Why does the magnetic force get weaker when you move farther away?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Core Material. The type of metal inside the coil — iron cores concentrate magnetic fields better than air
How would you model that?

Distance from Object. Magnetic force decreases rapidly with distance — the closer the object, the stronger the pull
How would you model that?

Temperature. Heating a magnet weakens it because thermal energy disrupts the alignment of magnetic domains
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: The Invisible Force That Charges Your Phone
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and the foundation of modern technology. Every electric motor, generator, speaker, and MRI machine relies on the connection between electricity and magnetism discovered in the 1800s.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS2-3, MS-PS2-5: Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces. Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to provide evidence that fields exist between objects exerting forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Asking Questions and Planning Investigations
  Students ask questions about data and design investigations to determine factors affecting electromagnetic force strength.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS2.B Types of Interactions
  Electric and magnetic forces between a pair of objects do not require contact. The sizes of the forces in each situation depend on the properties of the objects and their distances apart.
• Crosscutting Concept: Cause and Effect
  Students identify that specific changes in current and coils CAUSE predictable changes in magnetic field strength and lifting capacity.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Electromagnet, Magnetic Field, Electric Current, Electromagnetic Induction
□ Prepare How can a force you can't see, smell, or touch move objects and transfer energy discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify electric current, number of coil wraps, magnetic field strength, and lifting capacity as components of the electromagnetic system.
• Establish: Students determine that both current and coils positively affect field strength, which positively affects lifting capacity.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how electrical inputs create magnetic force outputs.
• Evaluate: Students run low power, maximum coils, and full power scenarios to test how variables affect strength.
• Revise: Students add core material or distance to explore more complex electromagnetic interactions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Electricity Creates Magnetism:
  In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that electric current creates a magnetic field around a wire. This was revolutionary — it showed that electricity and magnetism are not separate forces but aspects of the same phenomenon. Every wire carrying current is a tiny magnet.

• How Electromagnets Work:
  Wrapping current-carrying wire into a coil concentrates the magnetic field. Each loop of wire adds its field to the next, creating a much stronger combined field. Adding an iron core further amplifies the effect because iron is easily magnetized, aligning its internal magnetic domains with the coil's field.

• Factors Affecting Strength:
  Three main factors control electromagnet strength: (1) Current — more current means a stronger field; (2) Number of coils — more wraps concentrate the field; (3) Core material — ferromagnetic materials like iron amplify the field. These factors combine to determine the total electromagnetic force.

• Real-World Applications:
  Electromagnets are everywhere: electric motors (fans, cars, power tools), generators (power plants), speakers (phones, headphones), MRI machines (hospitals), maglev trains, and junkyard cranes. The ability to turn magnetism on and off with a switch makes electromagnets far more versatile than permanent magnets.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Magnets are magic"
  Reality: Magnetism is a fundamental force of nature with well-understood physics. It results from the motion of electric charges at the atomic level. Every magnet works because of electron behavior.
  Strategy: Build an electromagnet. Turn current on = magnet. Turn off = not a magnet. It's physics, not magic.

• "Electricity and magnetism are unrelated"
  Reality: Electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the SAME force — electromagnetism. Moving charges create magnetic fields, and moving magnets create electric current. They are fundamentally linked.
  Strategy: Show Oersted's experiment: a compass needle deflects when current flows through a nearby wire.

• "Bigger magnets are always stronger"
  Reality: Size alone doesn't determine magnet strength. An electromagnet's strength depends on current, number of coils, and core material — not just physical size. A small, well-designed electromagnet can be stronger than a large one.
  Strategy: Compare a large weak magnet to a small powerful one. Measure lifting capacity of each.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: How can a force you can't see, smell, or touch move objects and transfer energy?
Answer: Invisible electromagnetic forces work because moving electric charges (current) create magnetic fields around them. By wrapping wire into coils and increasing current, we concentrate this invisible force into something strong enough to lift cars in junkyards — all from a force you can't see!

Simulation Answers:
• Maximum Coils Scenario: When Number of Coil Wraps is maximized with moderate current, Magnetic Field Strength increases significantly. Lifting Capacity rises proportionally. Each additional coil contributes to the total field strength.
• Full Power Scenario: When both Electric Current AND Coil Wraps are at maximum, Magnetic Field Strength reaches its peak. The combined effect is greater than either variable alone — they multiply rather than simply add. This demonstrates why real electromagnets optimize BOTH variables.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why are electromagnets more useful than permanent magnets?
  A: Electromagnets can be turned ON and OFF with a switch — permanent magnets can't. This is critical for applications like junkyard cranes (pick up, move, drop), MRI machines (controlled scanning), electric motors (alternating field creates rotation), and speakers (rapidly changing field creates sound waves).
• Q: How does your phone use electromagnetic forces?
  A: Your phone's speaker uses an electromagnet to vibrate a diaphragm (sound). The vibration motor is a tiny electric motor (electromagnetic rotation). Wireless charging uses electromagnetic induction. The cellular antenna sends and receives electromagnetic waves. The touchscreen uses electric fields to detect your finger.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design the Ultimate Electromagnet
Mission: Engineer the strongest possible electromagnet using limited materials, then test it by measuring how much weight it can lift.
Scenario: A recycling facility needs a new electromagnet crane to sort metal from waste. Your engineering team must design and test a prototype that lifts the maximum weight using the materials provided.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A recycling facility needs a prototype electromagnet crane. Your team must design one that lifts the maximum weight using limited materials. Test, measure, and optimize your design.

Key Concepts:
• Magnetic Domains: Inside ferromagnetic materials like iron, groups of atoms create tiny magnetic regions called domains. An external field aligns these domains, amplifying the effect.
• Electromagnetic Induction: Moving a magnet through a coil of wire generates electric current — the reverse of making an electromagnet. This is how generators and power plants produce electricity.
• Field Strength vs. Distance: Magnetic force follows an inverse relationship with distance — doubling the distance reduces the force dramatically. This is why electromagnets must be close to the object they're lifting.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design optimizes both current and coils, tests multiple configurations, records data, and explains electromagnetic principles
• Proficient (3): Design systematically tests at least two variables and records lifting capacity data
• Developing (2): Design builds a working electromagnet but doesn't systematically test variables
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or electromagnet doesn't function

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a step-by-step guide for building a basic electromagnet (battery + wire + nail)
  • Use iron filings on paper to visualize magnetic field lines around the electromagnet
  • Sentence frames: 'When I increased the number of coils, the lifting capacity __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research how MRI machines use powerful electromagnets to image the human body
  • Build a simple electric motor using an electromagnet and permanent magnet
  • Investigate electromagnetic induction by moving a magnet through a coil connected to an LED

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph the relationship between number of coils and lifting capacity — is it linear or exponential?
  • ELA: Write a technical report documenting your electromagnet design process and results
  • Social Studies: Research how electromagnetic technology (telegraph, motors, generators) transformed society in the 1800s

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Identify factors that affect the strength of electromagnetic forces
• Provide evidence that fields exist between objects not in contact
• Design investigations to test electromagnetic principles

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A student wraps 50 turns of wire around an iron nail and connects it to a battery. The electromagnet picks up 10 paper clips. Which change would most likely INCREASE the number of paper clips it can lift?
• Constructed Response: Design an experiment to test how the number of coil wraps affects the strength of an electromagnet. Include your hypothesis, variables, and how you would measure the results.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design the Ultimate Electromagnet
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Engineer the strongest possible electromagnet using limited materials, then test it by measuring how much weight it can lift.

SCENARIO: A recycling facility needs a new electromagnet crane to sort metal from waste. Your engineering team must design and test a prototype that lifts the maximum weight using the materials provided.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What combination of current and coils produces the strongest electromagnet?
• How does the core material affect electromagnet strength?
• What are the limits of your design — when does adding more coils or current stop helping?

DESIGN THINKING:
• How many coil wraps will you use and why?

  _________________________________________________________

• What power level will you set your current to?

  _________________________________________________________

• What core material will give the best results?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure and record your electromagnet's lifting capacity?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design optimizes both current and coils, tests multiple configurations, records data, and explains electromagnetic principles
• Proficient (3): Design systematically tests at least two variables and records lifting capacity data
• Developing (2): Design builds a working electromagnet but doesn't systematically test variables
• Beginning (1): Design is incomplete or electromagnet doesn't function
