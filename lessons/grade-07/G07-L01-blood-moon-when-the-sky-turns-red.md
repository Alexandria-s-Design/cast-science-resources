### Title
**Blood Moon: When the Sky Turns Red — The Cosmic Dance of Earth, Moon, and Sun**

### Overview
The Earth-Moon-Sun system creates some of the most dramatic natural phenomena visible from Earth — lunar phases, eclipses, and tides. Understanding these patterns requires modeling how gravity, orbital mechanics, and light interact across vast distances. Students investigate the driving question: Why does the Moon change shape every night and sometimes turn blood red? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

BLOOD MOON: WHEN THE SKY TURNS RED

The Cosmic Dance of Earth, Moon, and Sun.
Why does the Moon change shape every night and sometimes turn blood red?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Sun Angle" — the angle of sunlight hitting the earth-moon system
  ○ Click "Moon Position" — where the moon is in its 29
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Earth's Shadow" — the cone of darkness cast by earth into space
  ○ Click "Visible Moon Phase" — how much of the moon's surface appears lit when viewed from earth

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"Why does the Moon change shape every night and sometimes turn blood red?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Sun Angle' — that's external. The angle of sunlight hitting the Earth-Moon system.
Click on 'Moon Position' — that's external. Where the Moon is in its 29.
Click on 'Earth's Shadow' — that's internal. The cone of darkness cast by Earth into space.
Click on 'Visible Moon Phase' — that's internal. How much of the Moon's surface appears lit when viewed from Earth.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Sun Angle and Moon Position are external because they are determined by orbital mechanics — we can't control where the Sun's light comes from or where the Moon is in its orbit. Earth's Shadow and Visible Moon Phase are internal because they change as a direct result of the positions of these celestial bodies.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Sun Angle" and drag an arrow to "Visible Moon Phase"
• Click on "Moon Position" and drag an arrow to "Earth's Shadow"
• Click on "Earth's Shadow" and drag an arrow to "Visible Moon Phase"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Sun Angle → Visible Moon Phase = POSITIVE (+)
    When the Sun's angle allows more direct light to hit the Moon's Earth-facing side, we see more of the Moon illuminated (fuller phases).

  ○ Moon Position → Earth's Shadow = POSITIVE (+)
    When the Moon's position moves into alignment behind Earth, it enters Earth's shadow, creating eclipse conditions.

  ○ Earth's Shadow → Visible Moon Phase = NEGATIVE (−)
    When Earth's shadow covers the Moon (eclipse), the visible illuminated phase decreases dramatically — the Moon darkens or turns red.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When the Moon's position moves directly behind Earth (relative to the Sun), what happens to Earth's shadow and the visible Moon phase?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Sun Angle' and drag an arrow
over to 'Visible Moon Phase.'

Here's the key question: When sun angle goes UP, does
visible moon phase go UP or DOWN?

When the Sun's angle allows more direct light to hit the Moon's Earth-facing side, we see more of the Moon illuminated (fuller phases).
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Moon Position' and drag an arrow
over to 'Earth's Shadow.'

Here's the key question: When moon position goes UP, does
earth's shadow go UP or DOWN?

When the Moon's position moves into alignment behind Earth, it enters Earth's shadow, creating eclipse conditions.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Earth's Shadow' and drag an arrow
over to 'Visible Moon Phase.'

Here's the key question: When earth's shadow goes UP, does
visible moon phase go UP or DOWN?

When Earth's shadow covers the Moon (eclipse), the visible illuminated phase decreases dramatically — the Moon darkens or turns red.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When the Moon's position moves directly behind Earth (relative to the Sun), what happens to Earth's shadow and the visible Moon phase?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Sun Angle is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — FULL MOON
• Moon on opposite side of Earth from Sun, not in shadow
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict the Visible Moon Phase will be when the Moon is fully facing the Sun?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — LUNAR ECLIPSE
• Moon passes through Earth's Shadow directly
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to the Moon's appearance when it enters Earth's shadow?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — NEW MOON
• Moon between Earth and Sun
• PREDICT FIRST: Why do you predict we can't see the Moon during this phase?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• The Moon doesn't produce its own light — it reflects sunlight, so its appearance depends on position
• Lunar eclipses turn the Moon red because Earth's atmosphere bends red light into the shadow
• Eclipses don't happen every month because the Moon's orbit is tilted 5 degrees relative to Earth's
• Gravity is the invisible force that keeps the Moon orbiting Earth and Earth orbiting the Sun

THE ANSWER: The Moon appears to change shape because we see different amounts of its sunlit side as it orbits Earth. During a lunar eclipse, Earth blocks direct sunlight but our atmosphere bends red wavelengths into the shadow — painting the Moon blood red!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Full Moon. Moon on opposite side of Earth from Sun, not in shadow.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Lunar Eclipse.
Moon passes through Earth's Shadow directly.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to the Moon's appearance when it enters Earth's shadow?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: New Moon. Moon between Earth and Sun.
Why do you predict we can't see the Moon during this phase?

Here's what our model reveals: The Moon appears to change shape because we see different amounts of its sunlit side as it orbits Earth. During a lunar eclipse, Earth blocks direct sunlight but our atmosphere bends red wavelengths into the shadow — painting the Moon blood red!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Sun Angle?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Moon Position?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Tidal Force — The gravitational pull of the Moon that creates ocean tides on Earth
   • Orbital Tilt — The 5-degree tilt of the Moon's orbit that determines when eclipses can occur
   • Solar Eclipse — When the Moon passes between Earth and Sun, blocking sunlight

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Lunar Phases — how does this connect to your model?
   • Lunar Eclipses — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why don't we get a lunar eclipse every single month?
   • How does your model show that the Moon doesn't produce its own light?
   • What would happen to the Moon's phases if the Moon orbited faster?
   • How are lunar eclipses and solar eclipses different in your model?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Tidal Force. The gravitational pull of the Moon that creates ocean tides on Earth
How would you model that?

Orbital Tilt. The 5-degree tilt of the Moon's orbit that determines when eclipses can occur
How would you model that?

Solar Eclipse. When the Moon passes between Earth and Sun, blocking sunlight
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Blood Moon: When the Sky Turns Red
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
The Earth-Moon-Sun system creates some of the most dramatic natural phenomena visible from Earth — lunar phases, eclipses, and tides. Understanding these patterns requires modeling how gravity, orbital mechanics, and light interact across vast distances.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS1-1, MS-ESS1-2: Develop and use a model of the Earth-Sun-Moon system to describe the cyclic patterns of lunar phases, eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and seasons. Develop and use a model to describe the role of gravity in the motions within galaxies and the solar system.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a computational model of the Earth-Sun-Moon system to explain lunar phases and eclipses.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS1.A/B The Universe and the Solar System
  Patterns of the apparent motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars can be observed, described, predicted, and explained with models.
• Crosscutting Concept: Patterns
  Students identify the cyclic patterns of lunar phases and the conditions required for eclipses to occur.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Lunar Eclipse, Orbital Period, Penumbra, Revolution
□ Prepare Why does the Moon change shape every night and sometimes turn blood red discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify Sun angle, Moon position, Earth's shadow, and visible Moon phase as key components of the lunar phase system.
• Establish: Students determine that Moon position and Sun angle together determine Earth's shadow and visible phase through positive and negative relationships.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how the Moon's orbital position creates predictable phase patterns.
• Evaluate: Students run full moon, eclipse, and new moon scenarios to test their model's predictions against real observations.
• Revise: Students add tidal force or orbital tilt to explore more complex Earth-Moon interactions.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Lunar Phases:
  The Moon completes one orbit around Earth every 29.5 days. As it orbits, the angle between Sun, Moon, and Earth changes, illuminating different portions of the Moon's surface. The Moon doesn't produce light — it reflects sunlight. New moon occurs when the Moon is between Earth and Sun, and full moon when Earth is between Sun and Moon.

• Lunar Eclipses:
  A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon. The Moon turns red because Earth's atmosphere refracts red wavelengths of sunlight into the shadow. Eclipses don't happen monthly because the Moon's orbit is tilted 5.1 degrees relative to Earth's orbital plane.

• Gravity and Orbits:
  Gravity is the attractive force between all objects with mass. The Moon orbits Earth because gravity provides the centripetal force for orbital motion. The same force creates tides — the Moon's gravity pulls on Earth's oceans, creating bulges on opposite sides of the planet.

• Scale and Distance:
  The Moon is about 384,400 km from Earth. Light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth and an additional 1.3 seconds to reach the Moon. The Moon's diameter is about 1/4 of Earth's, making accurate physical models challenging to build.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "The Moon makes its own light"
  Reality: The Moon has no light source — it reflects sunlight. What we call moonlight is actually reflected sunlight. The Moon's brightness depends entirely on its position relative to the Sun.
  Strategy: Shine a flashlight on a ball in a dark room. Ask: Is the ball producing light or reflecting it?

• "Earth's shadow causes Moon phases"
  Reality: Moon phases are caused by the ANGLE at which we see the Moon's sunlit side, not by Earth's shadow. Earth's shadow only affects the Moon during the rare event of a lunar eclipse.
  Strategy: Use a ball and flashlight. Show that turning the ball creates phases without any shadow from a third object.

• "The Moon changes shape"
  Reality: The Moon doesn't physically change — it's always a sphere. What changes is how much of its sunlit side we can see from Earth as it orbits. We're seeing different ANGLES, not different shapes.
  Strategy: Hold a ball under a light and walk around it. Notice you see different amounts of the lit side.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why does the Moon change shape every night and sometimes turn blood red?
Answer: The Moon appears to change shape because we see different amounts of its sunlit side as it orbits Earth. During a lunar eclipse, Earth blocks direct sunlight but our atmosphere bends red wavelengths into the shadow — painting the Moon blood red!

Simulation Answers:
• Full Moon Scenario: When Moon Position is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, Visible Moon Phase is at maximum. We see the Moon's entire sunlit face. Earth's Shadow is minimal because the Moon is not aligned with the shadow.
• Lunar Eclipse Scenario: When Moon Position aligns exactly behind Earth relative to the Sun, Earth's Shadow engulfs the Moon. Visible Moon Phase drops significantly, and the Moon turns red because Earth's atmosphere bends red light into the shadow zone.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why don't we get an eclipse every month?
  A: The Moon's orbit is tilted about 5 degrees relative to Earth's orbit around the Sun. Most months, the Moon passes above or below Earth's shadow. Eclipses only happen when the Moon crosses the plane of Earth's orbit at exactly the right time — about 2-4 times per year.
• Q: Why does the Moon turn red?
  A: Earth's atmosphere acts like a lens, bending sunlight around our planet. Blue and green wavelengths scatter away (same reason our sky is blue), but red wavelengths bend enough to reach the Moon inside the shadow. It's essentially projecting all of Earth's sunsets onto the Moon simultaneously.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Moon Phase Predictor
Mission: Design a physical or digital tool that can predict the Moon's phase and eclipse events for any date, using your understanding of orbital mechanics.
Scenario: A local planetarium needs a hands-on exhibit that helps visitors understand why the Moon changes shape and when the next eclipse will occur. Your team has been hired to build the prototype.
Introduction: Present the challenge: A planetarium needs a hands-on exhibit teaching visitors about Moon phases and eclipses. Your team will design and build a working prototype that demonstrates the Earth-Moon-Sun system.

Key Concepts:
• Orbital Mechanics: The Moon orbits Earth due to gravity, completing one revolution every 29.5 days. The geometry of this orbit determines what we see from Earth's surface.
• Light and Shadow: The Moon has no light of its own — it reflects sunlight. The amount we see depends on the Moon's position relative to Earth and Sun.
• Atmospheric Refraction: Earth's atmosphere bends light waves, especially red wavelengths. During eclipses, this bending creates the blood-red color instead of total darkness.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Model accurately demonstrates all major Moon phases, shows eclipse mechanics, and explains the red color phenomenon
• Proficient (3): Model shows major Moon phases and explains why eclipses occur
• Developing (2): Model shows some phases but doesn't clearly demonstrate eclipse mechanics
• Beginning (1): Model is incomplete or doesn't accurately represent the Earth-Moon-Sun relationship

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a printed Moon phase diagram with positions labeled for reference
  • Use a flashlight and tennis balls to physically demonstrate Sun-Moon-Earth alignment
  • Sentence frames: 'When the Moon is at this position, we see __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research the difference between lunar and solar eclipses and model both
  • Calculate how many full moons occur in one year using the 29.5-day orbital period
  • Investigate how the Moon's gravity creates tides and add tidal force to the model

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate the Moon's orbital period and predict future eclipse dates using astronomical data
  • ELA: Research and write about how ancient cultures explained lunar eclipses through mythology
  • Art: Create a scale poster showing the Earth-Moon-Sun system with accurate proportions

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Use a model to describe cyclic patterns of lunar phases
• Explain the role of gravity in the Earth-Moon-Sun system
• Predict when and why eclipses occur based on orbital mechanics

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: During a lunar eclipse, the Moon appears red instead of disappearing completely. Which best explains this observation?
• Constructed Response: Using a model of the Earth-Sun-Moon system, explain why we see different Moon phases throughout a month and why eclipses don't happen every month.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Moon Phase Predictor
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a physical or digital tool that can predict the Moon's phase and eclipse events for any date, using your understanding of orbital mechanics.

SCENARIO: A local planetarium needs a hands-on exhibit that helps visitors understand why the Moon changes shape and when the next eclipse will occur. Your team has been hired to build the prototype.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• How can you represent the Moon's orbit to accurately show phases?
• What determines whether a full moon is a normal full moon or an eclipse?
• How would your predictor account for the Moon's tilted orbit?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What materials will you use to represent Earth, Moon, and Sun?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you show the Moon's orbital tilt and why eclipses are rare?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will your exhibit demonstrate why the Moon turns red during eclipses?

  _________________________________________________________

• How can visitors interact with your model to explore different phases?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Model accurately demonstrates all major Moon phases, shows eclipse mechanics, and explains the red color phenomenon
• Proficient (3): Model shows major Moon phases and explains why eclipses occur
• Developing (2): Model shows some phases but doesn't clearly demonstrate eclipse mechanics
• Beginning (1): Model is incomplete or doesn't accurately represent the Earth-Moon-Sun relationship
