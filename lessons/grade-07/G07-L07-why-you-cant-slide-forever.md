### Title
**Why You Can't Slide Forever — The Hidden Energy Transfers That Stop Everything**

### Overview
Energy is one of the most fundamental concepts in all of science. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed — only transferred or transformed. Understanding energy transfer is key to everything from designing brakes to building power plants. Students investigate the driving question: Why does every moving thing eventually stop — and where does the energy go? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

WHY YOU CAN'T SLIDE FOREVER

The Hidden Energy Transfers That Stop Everything.
Why does every moving thing eventually stop — and where does the energy go?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Initial Speed" — how fast the object is moving at the start — determines the starting kinetic energy
  ○ Click "Surface Friction" — how rough or smooth the surface is — rougher surfaces create more friction force
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Kinetic Energy" — the energy of motion — decreases as friction slows the object down
  ○ Click "Thermal Energy Output" — the heat generated by friction — energy doesn't disappear

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

```
"Why does every moving thing eventually stop — and where does the energy go?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Initial Speed' — that's external. How fast the object is moving at the start — determines the starting kinetic energy.
Click on 'Surface Friction' — that's external. How rough or smooth the surface is — rougher surfaces create more friction force.
Click on 'Kinetic Energy' — that's internal. The energy of motion — decreases as friction slows the object down.
Click on 'Thermal Energy Output' — that's internal. The heat generated by friction — energy doesn't disappear.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Initial Speed and Surface Friction are external because they are inputs that determine the starting conditions and the rate of energy transfer. Kinetic Energy and Thermal Energy Output are internal because they change as a result of the interaction between the moving object and the surface.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Initial Speed" and drag an arrow to "Kinetic Energy"
• Click on "Surface Friction" and drag an arrow to "Kinetic Energy"
• Click on "Surface Friction" and drag an arrow to "Thermal Energy Output"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Initial Speed → Kinetic Energy = POSITIVE (+)
    Faster initial speed means more kinetic energy. Speed has a squared relationship with KE — doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy.

  ○ Surface Friction → Kinetic Energy = NEGATIVE (−)
    More friction means kinetic energy is lost faster. Rough surfaces oppose motion more strongly, slowing objects down quickly.

  ○ Surface Friction → Thermal Energy Output = POSITIVE (+)
    More friction converts more kinetic energy into heat. The energy isn't lost — it's transformed into thermal energy in the surfaces.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 1 negative relationship(s), 2 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When surface friction is very high, kinetic energy drops fast. But the total energy in the system hasn't changed — so where did it go?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Initial Speed' and drag an arrow
over to 'Kinetic Energy.'

Here's the key question: When initial speed goes UP, does
kinetic energy go UP or DOWN?

Faster initial speed means more kinetic energy. Speed has a squared relationship with KE — doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Surface Friction' and drag an arrow
over to 'Kinetic Energy.'

Here's the key question: When surface friction goes UP, does
kinetic energy go UP or DOWN?

More friction means kinetic energy is lost faster. Rough surfaces oppose motion more strongly, slowing objects down quickly.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Surface Friction' and drag an arrow
over to 'Thermal Energy Output.'

Here's the key question: When surface friction goes UP, does
thermal energy output go UP or DOWN?

More friction converts more kinetic energy into heat. The energy isn't lost — it's transformed into thermal energy in the surfaces.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 1 negative and 2
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When surface friction is very high, kinetic energy drops fast. But the total energy in the system hasn't changed — so where did it go?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Initial Speed is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — ICE (LOW FRICTION)
• Very low surface friction, moderate initial speed
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Kinetic Energy on a nearly frictionless surface?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — CONCRETE (HIGH FRICTION)
• High surface friction, same initial speed
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict happens to Thermal Energy Output when friction is high?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — SPEED COMPARISON
• Same surface, but double the initial speed
• PREDICT FIRST: How does doubling the speed affect Kinetic Energy and the time it takes to stop?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Energy is never created or destroyed — it only changes form (conservation of energy)
• Friction converts kinetic energy into thermal energy — that's why your hands get warm when you rub them
• Smoother surfaces mean less friction and slower energy conversion — objects slide farther
• Kinetic energy depends on speed SQUARED — doubling speed quadruples the energy

THE ANSWER: Nothing ever slides forever because friction converts kinetic energy (motion) into thermal energy (heat). The energy doesn't disappear — it transforms. Rub your hands together and feel the heat — that's kinetic energy becoming thermal energy right in your palms! Energy is always conserved.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Ice (Low Friction). Very low surface friction, moderate initial speed.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Concrete (High Friction).
High surface friction, same initial speed.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict happens to Thermal Energy Output when friction is high?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Speed Comparison. Same surface, but double the initial speed.
How does doubling the speed affect Kinetic Energy and the time it takes to stop?

Here's what our model reveals: Nothing ever slides forever because friction converts kinetic energy (motion) into thermal energy (heat). The energy doesn't disappear — it transforms. Rub your hands together and feel the heat — that's kinetic energy becoming thermal energy right in your palms! Energy is always conserved.

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 4: REVISE & EXTEND — Play, Research, Expand

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Initial Speed?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Surface Friction?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Air Resistance — The friction force between a moving object and the air, which increases with speed
   • Mass — Heavier objects have more kinetic energy at the same speed and take more force to stop
   • Surface Area — More contact area between surfaces can increase the total friction force

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Kinetic Energy — how does this connect to your model?
   • Friction and Heat — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • If energy can't be created or destroyed, where does ALL the energy from a moving car go when it brakes?
   • Why do space probes keep moving for decades without engines — doesn't that violate your model?
   • How is the friction that stops a skateboard the same concept as the friction that starts a campfire?
   • Why does doubling your speed quadruple your kinetic energy instead of just doubling it?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Air Resistance. The friction force between a moving object and the air, which increases with speed
How would you model that?

Mass. Heavier objects have more kinetic energy at the same speed and take more force to stop
How would you model that?

Surface Area. More contact area between surfaces can increase the total friction force
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why You Can't Slide Forever
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Energy is one of the most fundamental concepts in all of science. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed — only transferred or transformed. Understanding energy transfer is key to everything from designing brakes to building power plants.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-PS3-5: Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Engaging in Argument from Evidence
  Students construct and present arguments using model evidence that energy is transferred when kinetic energy changes.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: PS3.B Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer
  When the motion energy of an object changes, there is inevitably some other change in energy at the same time — energy is conserved.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students track energy as it transfers from kinetic to thermal form, demonstrating that energy is conserved even as it changes form.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 45-60 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Kinetic Energy, Friction, Energy Transfer, Thermal Energy
□ Prepare Why does every moving thing eventually stop — and where does the energy go discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify initial speed, surface friction, kinetic energy, and thermal energy output as components of the energy transfer system.
• Establish: Students determine that friction negatively affects kinetic energy but positively transfers it to thermal energy — energy is conserved through transformation.
• Visualize: Students build a model showing how kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy through friction.
• Evaluate: Students run ice, concrete, and carpet scenarios to compare energy transfer rates on different surfaces.
• Revise: Students add air resistance or mass to explore more complex energy transfer dynamics.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Kinetic Energy:
  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, calculated as KE = ½mv². This means kinetic energy depends on both mass and speed — but speed has a SQUARED effect. Doubling the mass doubles the energy, but doubling the speed QUADRUPLES it. This is why high-speed crashes are so much more destructive.

• Friction and Heat:
  Friction is a force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact. It converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (heat) through microscopic interactions between surface irregularities. This is why brakes get hot, why rubbing your hands warms them, and why meteors burn up entering the atmosphere.

• Conservation of Energy:
  The total energy in a closed system remains constant. When a sliding object stops, its kinetic energy hasn't disappeared — it has been transformed into thermal energy (heat in the surfaces and surrounding air). If you could measure all the heat produced, it would exactly equal the kinetic energy lost.

• Real-World Applications:
  Engineers use energy transfer principles everywhere: car brakes convert kinetic to thermal energy (disc brakes can reach 300°C), regenerative braking in electric cars converts kinetic back to electrical energy, and heat shields on spacecraft manage the enormous thermal energy from atmospheric friction.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Energy disappears when objects stop"
  Reality: Energy is NEVER created or destroyed — this is the law of conservation of energy. When a ball stops rolling, its kinetic energy has been converted to thermal energy (heat) in the surface and surrounding air.
  Strategy: Rub your hands vigorously. The motion stops, but you feel HEAT. That's the energy — it transformed.

• "Friction only slows things down"
  Reality: Friction also enables motion! Without friction, you couldn't walk (feet would slip), cars couldn't drive (tires wouldn't grip), and you couldn't hold anything. Friction is essential for controlled movement.
  Strategy: Try to walk on ice. Friction is what you MISS when it's gone.

• "Heavier objects always stop faster"
  Reality: Heavier objects have MORE kinetic energy at the same speed (KE = ½mv²), so they actually require MORE friction force to stop. This is why loaded trucks need longer stopping distances than empty ones.
  Strategy: Push a heavy book and a light book at the same speed. The heavy one slides farther because it has more KE to convert.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why does every moving thing eventually stop — and where does the energy go?
Answer: Nothing ever slides forever because friction converts kinetic energy (motion) into thermal energy (heat). The energy doesn't disappear — it transforms. Rub your hands together and feel the heat — that's kinetic energy becoming thermal energy right in your palms! Energy is always conserved.

Simulation Answers:
• Ice vs. Concrete Scenario: On ice (low friction), Kinetic Energy decreases very slowly and the object slides a long distance. On concrete (high friction), Kinetic Energy drops rapidly. In both cases, Thermal Energy Output accounts for the lost kinetic energy — confirming energy conservation.
• Speed Comparison Scenario: When Initial Speed is doubled, Kinetic Energy quadruples (KE = ½mv²). The object takes much longer to stop because there's four times as much energy to convert to heat. This is why stopping distance increases dramatically at higher speeds — and why speed limits save lives.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Where does all the energy go when a car brakes?
  A: When a car brakes, the brake pads press against the rotors, creating friction. The car's kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy — the brakes can reach 300°C or more. Some energy also goes into sound (squealing) and deforming the brake pad material. The total energy is conserved.
• Q: Why do space probes move forever?
  A: In space, there's essentially no friction — no air, no surface contact. Without friction, there's nothing to convert kinetic energy into another form. So objects in space keep their kinetic energy and continue moving at the same speed indefinitely. This is Newton's First Law in action.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design the Longest Slide
Mission: Engineer a slide or ramp system that keeps an object moving the longest distance possible by minimizing energy lost to friction.
Scenario: A toy company wants to design the world's longest toy car track. Your engineering team must maximize the distance a toy car travels by understanding and minimizing energy losses.
Introduction: A toy company needs the longest possible track for a new toy car product. Your engineering team must minimize energy lost to friction by choosing the best surface materials and track design.

Key Concepts:
• Coefficient of Friction: A number representing how much friction a surface produces. Ice has a low coefficient (~0.03), rubber on concrete is high (~0.8). Lower coefficient means less energy lost.
• Energy Conservation: The total energy before and after must be equal. If a car starts with 10 joules of kinetic energy and ends with 0, then 10 joules of thermal energy must have been produced.
• Regenerative Braking: Electric cars can convert kinetic energy BACK into electrical energy instead of wasting it as heat. This is why electric cars are more energy-efficient than gas cars.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Track design tests multiple surfaces, records distance data, calculates energy transfer, and explains physics principles
• Proficient (3): Track design tests at least two surfaces with measured distances and connects to energy concepts
• Developing (2): Track is built but testing is unsystematic or energy concepts aren't clearly connected
• Beginning (1): Track is incomplete or student can't explain the energy transfer principles

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide toy cars and three pre-cut surface strips (smooth, medium, rough) for direct comparison
  • Use a thermometer to measure temperature change on surfaces after friction experiments
  • Sentence frames: 'When friction increases, kinetic energy __ and thermal energy __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Calculate KE = ½mv² for different speeds and graph the quadratic relationship
  • Research regenerative braking in electric vehicles and explain how it reverses energy transfer
  • Investigate how lubricants reduce friction and calculate the energy savings

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate kinetic energy at different speeds using KE = ½mv² and graph the results
  • ELA: Write an argument essay: 'Energy can never be destroyed — only transformed.' Use model evidence.
  • Social Studies: Research how understanding friction and energy transfer led to the Industrial Revolution

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Construct arguments that energy is transferred when kinetic energy changes
• Use evidence to explain that energy is conserved during transformations
• Predict how changing variables affects energy transfer rates

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: A toy car rolls down a ramp and across a rough carpet, gradually slowing to a stop. Which statement best explains where the car's kinetic energy went?
• Constructed Response: A student claims that when a ball stops rolling, the energy has been 'used up' and no longer exists. Using evidence from your model, construct an argument explaining what actually happens to the energy.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design the Longest Slide
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Engineer a slide or ramp system that keeps an object moving the longest distance possible by minimizing energy lost to friction.

SCENARIO: A toy company wants to design the world's longest toy car track. Your engineering team must maximize the distance a toy car travels by understanding and minimizing energy losses.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• What surface materials minimize friction and maximize distance?
• How does the starting height (potential energy) affect how far the car travels?
• What is the relationship between the energy lost to friction and the distance traveled?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What surface material will you use for your track and why?

  _________________________________________________________

• What starting height will give your car the most kinetic energy?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure the distance traveled and energy lost?

  _________________________________________________________

• What modifications can you make to reduce friction even further?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Track design tests multiple surfaces, records distance data, calculates energy transfer, and explains physics principles
• Proficient (3): Track design tests at least two surfaces with measured distances and connects to energy concepts
• Developing (2): Track is built but testing is unsystematic or energy concepts aren't clearly connected
• Beginning (1): Track is incomplete or student can't explain the energy transfer principles
