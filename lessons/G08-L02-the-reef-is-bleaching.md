### Title
**The Reef Is Bleaching — Why the World's Most Colorful Ecosystems Are Turning White**

### Overview
Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support approximately 25% of all marine species. Often called 'rainforests of the sea,' they are among the most biodiverse and economically valuable ecosystems on Earth. Students investigate the driving question: Why are coral reefs turning white and dying? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

THE REEF IS BLEACHING

Why the World's Most Colorful Ecosystems Are Turning White.
Why are coral reefs turning white and dying?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Ocean Temperature" — average water temperature in the reef zone
  ○ Click "Ocean Acidity (pH)" — how acidic the ocean water is
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Zooxanthellae Population" — symbiotic algae living inside coral that provide food and color
  ○ Click "Coral Health" — overall survival and growth rate of coral colonies

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.
```

### Video Script

"Why are coral reefs turning white and dying?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Ocean Temperature' — that's external. Average water temperature in the reef zone.
Click on 'Ocean Acidity (pH)' — that's external. How acidic the ocean water is.
Click on 'Zooxanthellae Population' — that's internal. Symbiotic algae living inside coral that provide food and color.
Click on 'Coral Health' — that's internal. Overall survival and growth rate of coral colonies.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Ocean Temperature and Ocean Acidity are external because they come from global climate conditions that are outside the reef system itself. Zooxanthellae Population and Coral Health are internal because they respond to and are shaped by those external conditions.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Ocean Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Zooxanthellae Population"
• Click on "Ocean Acidity" and drag an arrow to "Coral Health"
• Click on "Zooxanthellae Population" and drag an arrow to "Coral Health"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Ocean Temperature → Zooxanthellae Population = NEGATIVE (−)
    When temperature rises above normal, coral expels its zooxanthellae, reducing their population.

  ○ Ocean Acidity → Coral Health = NEGATIVE (−)
    Higher acidity makes it harder for coral to build its calcium carbonate skeleton.

  ○ Zooxanthellae Population → Coral Health = POSITIVE (+)
    More zooxanthellae means more energy for coral through photosynthesis — up to 90% of its food.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 2 negative relationship(s), 1 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When ocean temperature increases beyond normal levels, what do you think happens to the zooxanthellae living inside the coral?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Ocean Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Zooxanthellae Population.'

Here's the key question: When ocean temperature goes UP, does
zooxanthellae population go UP or DOWN?

When temperature rises above normal, coral expels its zooxanthellae, reducing their population.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Ocean Acidity' and drag an arrow
over to 'Coral Health.'

Here's the key question: When ocean acidity goes UP, does
coral health go UP or DOWN?

Higher acidity makes it harder for coral to build its calcium carbonate skeleton.
That's a NEGATIVE relationship. When one goes up, the other
goes DOWN. Click the minus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Zooxanthellae Population' and drag an arrow
over to 'Coral Health.'

Here's the key question: When zooxanthellae population goes UP, does
coral health go UP or DOWN?

More zooxanthellae means more energy for coral through photosynthesis — up to 90% of its food.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 2 negative and 1
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When ocean temperature increases beyond normal levels, what do you think happens to the zooxanthellae living inside the coral?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run Your Model

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Ocean Temperature is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — HEALTHY REEF
• Normal ocean temperature and pH
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Coral Health?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — HEAT WAVE SIMULATION
• Lock Ocean Temperature to +3°C above normal
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Zooxanthellae Population?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — DOUBLE THREAT
• Increase both temperature and acidity
• PREDICT FIRST: How does this compare to temperature alone?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Coral depends on zooxanthellae algae for up to 90% of its energy
• When water gets too warm, coral expels its algae — that's bleaching
• Ocean acidification makes it harder for coral to build its skeleton
• The combination of heat AND acidity is far worse than either alone

THE ANSWER: Rising ocean temperatures cause coral to expel the symbiotic algae they depend on for food, turning white (bleaching) and eventually starving to death!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Healthy Reef. Normal ocean temperature and pH.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Heat Wave Simulation.
Lock Ocean Temperature to +3°C above normal.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Zooxanthellae Population?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Double Threat. Increase both temperature and acidity.
How does this compare to temperature alone?

Here's what our model reveals: Rising ocean temperatures cause coral to expel the symbiotic algae they depend on for food, turning white (bleaching) and eventually starving to death!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Ocean Temperature?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Ocean Acidity (pH)?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Fish Population — Fish depend on coral for food and shelter
   • Algae Overgrowth — Without coral, algae can take over the reef
   • Human Tourism — Tourism dollars fund conservation but also cause damage

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • The Coral-Algae Symbiosis — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Bleaching Process — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is it called 'bleaching' if the coral isn't being washed with bleach?
   • How is the coral-zooxanthellae relationship similar to a business partnership?
   • If coral reefs disappear, what happens to the 25% of marine species that depend on them?
   • Why is the combination of heat and acidity worse than either factor alone?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Fish Population. Fish depend on coral for food and shelter
How would you model that?

Algae Overgrowth. Without coral, algae can take over the reef
How would you model that?

Human Tourism. Tourism dollars fund conservation but also cause damage
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TEACHER GUIDE: The Reef Is Bleaching
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support approximately 25% of all marine species. Often called 'rainforests of the sea,' they are among the most biodiverse and economically valuable ecosystems on Earth.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-LS2-1, MS-LS2-4: Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability on organisms and populations of organisms in an ecosystem. Construct an argument supported by empirical evidence that changes to physical or biological components of an ecosystem affect populations.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students build a model to analyze how changes in ocean conditions affect coral reef ecosystems.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience
  Ecosystems are dynamic; disruptions to components can cascade through the system.
• Crosscutting Concept: Stability and Change
  Students identify conditions that maintain reef stability vs. changes that push the system toward collapse.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Coral Bleaching, Symbiosis, Ecosystem Services, Trophic Cascade
□ Prepare Why are coral reefs turning white and dying discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify ocean temperature, ocean acidity, zooxanthellae population, and coral health as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that temperature and acidity both negatively affect zooxanthellae, which positively affects coral health.
• Visualize: Students build the coral reef model showing cascading effects from environmental stressors to ecosystem collapse.
• Evaluate: Students compare healthy reef, heat wave, and double threat scenarios.
• Revise: Students add fish population or algae overgrowth to model trophic cascades.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• The Coral-Algae Symbiosis:
  Coral polyps have a mutualistic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. The algae live inside coral tissue, photosynthesizing and providing up to 90% of the coral's energy. In return, coral provides shelter and nutrients. The algae also give coral its vibrant colors.

• The Bleaching Process:
  When water temperatures rise 1-2°C above the normal summer maximum for 4+ weeks, coral becomes stressed and expels its zooxanthellae. Without the algae, the coral's white skeleton shows through — hence 'bleaching.' Bleached coral isn't dead yet, but without its algae it starves and becomes vulnerable to disease.

• Ocean Acidification:
  The ocean absorbs about 30% of atmospheric CO2. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, lowering pH. More acidic water makes it harder for coral to build its calcium carbonate skeleton. This is sometimes called 'osteoporosis of the sea.'

• Global Reef Status:
  The Great Barrier Reef experienced mass bleaching events in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2024. Scientists estimate that 50% of the world's coral reefs have already been lost since the 1950s. If current trends continue, 90% could be gone by 2050.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Coral is a plant or rock"
  Reality: Coral is an ANIMAL — specifically, colonies of tiny polyps related to jellyfish. They build calcium carbonate skeletons but are very much alive.
  Strategy: Show video of coral polyps feeding at night. Ask: Do rocks eat?

• "Bleaching means the coral is dead"
  Reality: Bleached coral is stressed and starving but not necessarily dead. If conditions improve within weeks, zooxanthellae can recolonize and the coral can recover. But prolonged bleaching leads to death.
  Strategy: Analogy: Bleaching is like a high fever — dangerous but potentially survivable if treated.

• "Climate change only affects land"
  Reality: The ocean absorbs 90% of excess heat from global warming and 30% of CO2. Marine ecosystems are being dramatically affected by rising temperatures and acidification.
  Strategy: Show ocean temperature data alongside atmospheric temperature data.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why are coral reefs turning white and dying?
Answer: Rising ocean temperatures cause coral to expel the symbiotic algae they depend on for food, turning white (bleaching) and eventually starving to death!

Simulation Answers:
• Heat Wave Scenario: When Ocean Temperature increases +3°C, Zooxanthellae Population drops rapidly as coral expels its algae. Coral Health then crashes because it loses its primary food source. This is the bleaching cascade.
• Double Threat Scenario: When BOTH temperature and acidity increase, the effects are compounded. Zooxanthellae are expelled AND coral can't rebuild its skeleton. Recovery becomes nearly impossible because both energy supply and structural integrity are compromised.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why is it called bleaching?
  A: The vibrant colors of coral come from the zooxanthellae algae living inside them. When stress causes coral to expel these algae, the transparent coral tissue reveals the white calcium carbonate skeleton underneath. It looks 'bleached' but it's actually starving.
• Q: What can an 8th grader do?
  A: Reducing carbon footprint helps slow ocean warming and acidification. Supporting reef-safe sunscreen, reducing plastic waste, and advocating for marine protected areas all help. Understanding the science — like you're doing now — means you can explain the urgency to others.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Coral Reef Rescue Plan
Mission: Design a science-based plan to protect and restore a bleaching coral reef using evidence from your model.
Scenario: The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its worst bleaching event ever. Your marine science team has been hired to propose a rescue and prevention plan.
Introduction: Show students news footage of Great Barrier Reef bleaching. Present the challenge: You've been hired as marine science consultants. Your plan needs to use evidence from your model.

Key Concepts:
• Coral Nurseries: Growing heat-resistant coral in nurseries and transplanting them to damaged reefs.
• Marine Protected Areas: Limiting human activities like fishing and tourism in reef zones to reduce additional stress.
• Carbon Reduction: Addressing root cause by reducing CO2 emissions that drive ocean warming and acidification.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses both immediate rescue and long-term prevention, uses model evidence, includes measurable goals
• Proficient (3): Plan includes science-based strategies and references model data
• Developing (2): Plan mentions conservation but lacks specific model evidence
• Beginning (1): Plan doesn't connect to ecosystem dynamics or model findings

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide food web diagram showing coral reef trophic levels
  • Use color-coded cards for before/during/after bleaching
  • Sentence frames: 'When ocean temperature increases, zooxanthellae __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research and graph ocean temperature trends over the past 50 years
  • Add fish population and algae overgrowth components to model trophic cascade
  • Compare coral reef decline data from different oceans worldwide

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Graph and analyze ocean temperature anomaly data from NOAA for the past 30 years
  • ELA: Write a news article explaining coral bleaching to a general audience using scientific evidence
  • Social Studies: Research how coral reef loss affects economies of island nations that depend on reef tourism

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Analyze data showing how changes in one ecosystem component affect others
• Construct evidence-based arguments about ecosystem disruption
• Use models to predict effects of environmental changes on populations

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Ocean temperature rises 2°C above normal for 6 weeks. Which is the most likely immediate effect on a coral reef?
• Constructed Response: Using evidence from your model, explain how rising ocean temperatures lead to a cascade of effects that can collapse an entire coral reef ecosystem.

STEM CHALLENGE: Design a Coral Reef Rescue Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MISSION: Design a science-based plan to protect and restore a bleaching coral reef using evidence from your model.

SCENARIO: The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its worst bleaching event ever. Your marine science team has been hired to propose a rescue and prevention plan.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Which factors in your model can humans actually control?
• What temperature threshold triggers bleaching?
• How can we reduce ocean acidification locally?

DESIGN THINKING:
• What immediate actions can protect existing coral?

  _________________________________________________________

• How would you restore zooxanthellae populations?

  _________________________________________________________

• What long-term climate actions would prevent future bleaching?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you measure the success of your plan?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Plan addresses both immediate rescue and long-term prevention, uses model evidence, includes measurable goals
• Proficient (3): Plan includes science-based strategies and references model data
• Developing (2): Plan mentions conservation but lacks specific model evidence
• Beginning (1): Plan doesn't connect to ecosystem dynamics or model findings
