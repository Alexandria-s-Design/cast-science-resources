### Title
**How Soap Actually Destroys Viruses — The Chemical Reaction That Saves Millions of Lives Every Year**

### Overview
Students model the chemistry of handwashing — discovering that soap doesn't just rinse away viruses but actively destroys them through a chemical interaction with their outer membrane. By building a cause-and-effect model showing how soap concentration and water together determine soap effectiveness, which in turn destroys virus membranes and reduces virus survival, students understand why proper handwashing (with soap AND water, for 20 seconds) is one of the most powerful public health tools ever discovered. This lesson connects real-life personal health practice to chemistry principles.

### Cover Image

### Grade
5th

### NGSS Standard
**5-PS1-4**: Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain that soap destroys viruses through a chemical interaction, not just physical washing
- Model how soap concentration and water together determine soap effectiveness
- Trace how soap effectiveness leads to virus membrane disruption and lower survival
- Apply the model to explain why proper handwashing technique matters

### Component List (Starting Model: 4 Components)

| Component | Type | What It Represents |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Soap Concentration | External | How much soap is being applied — determined by how much soap you use |
| Water Present | External | Whether running water is present and activating the soap |
| Soap Effectiveness | Internal | How well the soap molecules are able to attack and disrupt virus membranes |
| Virus Survival Rate | Internal | The percentage of viruses that survive the handwashing process |

HOW SOAP ACTUALLY DESTROYS VIRUSES

You've been washing your hands your whole life. But do you know
what's actually happening?

Most people think soap washes away germs. Like, rinses them off.

That's partly true. But soap does something way more powerful
to many viruses: it DESTROYS them.

Here's the chemistry: many viruses — including flu, cold, and
COVID-19 — have an outer coating called a lipid membrane. It's
like their armor. It's also what allows them to infect cells.

Soap molecules are special. One end loves water. The other end
loves oil (and lipids). When you wash with soap and water, soap
molecules push into the virus's lipid armor, wedging between the
molecules that hold it together.

The armor shatters. The virus falls apart. It's dead.

You've been doing molecular demolition every time you wash your hands.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can choose/control):
  ○ Click "Soap Concentration" — how much soap you apply
  ○ Click "Water Present" — whether running water activates the soap
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Soap Effectiveness" — how well the soap can attack viruses
  ○ Click "Virus Survival Rate" — what percentage of viruses survive

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• EXTERNAL = what you control (or what's available)
• INTERNAL = what happens chemically as a result
• Sort them, then your teacher will explain the connections

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

20 seconds. Soap + water. Molecular demolition.
Let's model exactly how it works.
```

### Video Script

```
"You've been washing your hands since you could reach the sink.
But I want to ask you something: do you know what soap actually does?

If you think soap rinses germs off your hands, you're partly right.
But that's the boring version of what's happening.

Here's the real chemistry.

Many viruses — influenza, the common cold, COVID-19 — have an outer
coating called a lipid membrane. Think of it as armor made of fat
molecules locked together. This membrane is how the virus survives
in the environment. It's how the virus attaches to your cells and
infects them. Without it, the virus falls apart and dies.

Now here's what soap does to that armor.

Soap molecules have a special structure — they're called 'amphiphilic.'
One end of a soap molecule loves water. The other end loves oil and fat.

When you apply soap and water, soap molecules attack the virus's
lipid membrane. The fat-loving ends wedge into the membrane. They
push between the molecules that hold the armor together.

The membrane breaks apart. The virus's interior spills out. It can't
infect anything. It's dead.

You're not rinsing away germs. You're destroying them.

That's why handwashing with soap is one of the most powerful public
health discoveries in human history. It's prevented more deaths than
almost any other medical intervention.

Today you're going to model the chemistry of this process.

Look at your component panel.

Soap Concentration — external. How much soap you apply.

Water Present — also external. Running water is essential for
activating and rinsing.

Soap Effectiveness — internal. How well the soap molecules can
do their demolition work. This changes based on soap and water.

Virus Survival Rate — internal. What percentage of viruses make
it through the handwashing process alive. This is what we want
as close to zero as possible.

Sort your components. Add them. Let's model molecular demolition.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

```
THE CHEMISTRY OF CLEAN HANDS

Soap + water → soap effectiveness → virus destruction.
One positive chain, one negative payoff. Let's map it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Soap Concentration → Soap Effectiveness
• Water Present → Soap Effectiveness
• Soap Effectiveness → Virus Survival Rate

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
  ○ Soap Concentration → Soap Effectiveness = POSITIVE (+)
    More soap = MORE soap molecules available to attack membranes
    (More molecules = more demolition)

  ○ Water Present → Soap Effectiveness = POSITIVE (+)
    Water activates and mobilizes soap molecules
    Water also helps the mechanical scrubbing action work
    (Dry soap on hands is much less effective — water is essential!)

  ○ Soap Effectiveness → Virus Survival Rate = NEGATIVE (−)
    MORE effective soap = FEWER viruses surviving
    (This is the ONE negative relationship — it's the point!)

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• 3 arrows: 2 positive, 1 negative
• The negative relationship is the KEY — effectiveness REDUCES survival

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

KEY INSIGHT: Virus Survival Rate and Soap Effectiveness are INVERSELY
related. When soap works better, fewer viruses survive. The whole
point of handwashing is to make that final number as close to zero
as possible.
```

### Video Script

```
"Let's wire the molecular demolition system.

Click the Connect icon.

First: Soap Concentration to Soap Effectiveness.

Think about it this way: each soap molecule is a tiny demolition
tool. More soap concentration means more tools. More tools means
more virus membranes can be attacked simultaneously.

More soap = more effective soap. POSITIVE. Click the plus sign.

Second: Water Present to Soap Effectiveness.

Here's something most people don't realize: soap works much better
with water. The water does several things — it activates the soap,
helps it spread across your hands, and enables the mechanical
scrubbing action that physically disrupts the viruses.

Dry hands with hand sanitizer does something. But soap plus
running water does WAY more.

More water = more effective soap. POSITIVE again.

Third — and this is the payoff: Soap Effectiveness to Virus Survival Rate.

This is the NEGATIVE relationship. This is the whole point.

When soap is MORE effective, what happens to viruses?
They get DESTROYED. Fewer survive.

More effectiveness = LESS survival. NEGATIVE. Click the minus sign.

Look at your model. Two positive relationships build up to soap
being highly effective. One negative relationship converts that
effectiveness into virus destruction.

This is why 20 seconds matters. Less than 20 seconds? The soap
molecules haven't had enough time to work through all the surfaces
of your hands. Every extra second gives those soap molecules more
time to find and destroy membrane-covered viruses.

Now let's run it and see how close we can get Virus Survival Rate
to zero.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 3: VISUALIZE & EVALUATE — Run the Handwashing Model

### Text Editor

```
CAN WE GET VIRUS SURVIVAL TO ZERO?

Your model shows the chemistry of handwashing. Let's run it and
test different handwashing scenarios to see which works best.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click "Play" in the TOP LEFT
• Watch all four component lines on the graph

STEP 2: SCENARIO 1 — RINSING WITH WATER ONLY (No Soap)
• Lock Soap Concentration to ZERO (0%)
• Lock Water Present to HIGH (100%)
• What happens to Soap Effectiveness?
• What happens to Virus Survival Rate?
• Does water alone destroy viruses?

STEP 3: SCENARIO 2 — DRY SOAP (Soap, No Water)
• Lock Water Present to ZERO
• Set Soap Concentration to HIGH (100%)
• What happens now?
• Is soap without water effective?

STEP 4: SCENARIO 3 — PROPER HANDWASHING (Soap + Water)
• Unlock both. Set BOTH to HIGH (100%)
• Watch Soap Effectiveness climb
• Watch Virus Survival Rate drop
• How close to zero does it get?

STEP 5: BONUS — QUICK RINSE VS. 20-SECOND WASH
• Lower Water Present slightly to simulate a quick rinse (less contact time)
• Compare Virus Survival Rate to the full 20-second wash

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• Why isn't rinsing with water alone enough to kill viruses?
• Why is hand sanitizer (alcohol) useful but different from soap?
• What percentage of viruses survive the best handwashing scenario?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your handwashing chemistry model is ready. Let's test it against
the scenarios you encounter every day.

Click Play.

Scenario 1: Water only. No soap. Lock Soap Concentration to zero.
Water is flowing, but no soap molecules.

Watch Soap Effectiveness. It's near zero — water alone has almost
no ability to destroy lipid-coated viruses. It can rinse away some
particles, but it can't demolish membranes.

And Virus Survival Rate? High. Very high. Most viruses would survive
a water-only rinse. If someone just rinses their hands without soap
before touching food — the viruses are mostly still there.

Scenario 2: Soap with no water. Lock Water to zero.
Some soap is there, but no running water to activate it.

Watch Soap Effectiveness. Better than nothing — some soap molecules
are working. But without water mobilizing them across all surfaces?
Not nearly as effective. Virus Survival Rate drops some, but not enough.

This is why dry hand-rubbing with solid soap isn't recommended.

Scenario 3: Proper handwashing. Unlock both. Both at high.

Watch Soap Effectiveness climb. Both inputs are maxed — lots of
soap molecules, fully activated by water, spreading everywhere.

Watch Virus Survival Rate drop. It's heading toward zero. The
membrane-coated viruses are being destroyed.

THAT is what proper handwashing does.

Now try the quick rinse versus 20 seconds. Lower water slightly —
less contact time. Watch how much the Survival Rate rises. Every
second you rush, more viruses survive.

Twenty seconds. Up to your wrists. Between your fingers. Under
your nails. Every surface.

Your model just proved why it matters.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

SOAP: ONE OF HUMANITY'S GREATEST DISCOVERIES

Your model proves that soap + water = virus destruction. But soap
has been saving lives for centuries — and the science of why it
works is part of a much bigger story.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. FIND THE MINIMUM
   • What's the lowest Soap Concentration that still gets Virus
     Survival below 50%?
   • Is there a threshold — an amount below which soap doesn't really work?

2. EXPLORE HAND SANITIZER
   • Hand sanitizer uses alcohol instead of amphiphilic molecules
   • It works differently: alcohol dissolves in the lipid membrane directly
   • How would you modify your model for hand sanitizer?
   • (Hint: hand sanitizer doesn't need water — so which connection changes?)

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model captures the chemistry. Real handwashing involves more:

   • Scrubbing Friction — mechanical action breaks up clusters of viruses
   • Temperature — warm water helps soap molecules move faster
   • Time — every extra second gives soap more chances to attack membranes
   • Surface Area — under nails, between fingers where viruses hide
   • Antibacterial Soap — works on bacteria differently than viruses

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • What is a chemical reaction? Does handwashing involve one?
   • What are lipids? Why does soap interact with them?
   • What is the difference between a physical change and a chemical change?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • When was handwashing with soap first recommended by doctors?
     (Look up Ignaz Semmelweis — 1840s!)
   • Why does soap not kill all viruses? (Which viruses don't have lipid coatings?)
   • How much would it cost to provide soap and clean water to every
     person on Earth? (It's less than you think.)
   • What is the difference between soap and detergent?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Add "Scrubbing Time" as an External component
   • It has a POSITIVE effect on Soap Effectiveness
   • Run it. Does adding time change the Virus Survival Rate significantly?
   • This models exactly why 20 seconds matters
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model shows that soap plus water destroys virus membranes.
But I want to tell you something that should genuinely make you
angry — and then hopeful.

In the 1840s, a doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that women
giving birth in hospitals where doctors performed autopsies were
dying at much higher rates than those in midwife-run wards. He
figured out why: doctors were going from dissecting dead bodies
directly to delivering babies, with no handwashing.

He recommended doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime before
touching patients. The death rate dropped by 90%.

The medical establishment laughed at him. He was mocked, fired, and
eventually committed to a mental institution — where he died, ironically,
from an infection.

Twenty years later, Louis Pasteur's germ theory proved Semmelweis
was right. By then, millions of people had died from infections that
proper handwashing would have prevented.

Today, soap and water saves an estimated 1 million children's lives
per year. Just. Soap. And. Water.

Now your extension. Your model has Soap Concentration and Water, but
not TIME.

Add 'Scrubbing Time' as an External component. It has a positive
effect on Soap Effectiveness — more time means more chances for
soap molecules to find and destroy virus membranes.

Connect it. Run it.

When Scrubbing Time is high (20+ seconds), watch Virus Survival.
When Scrubbing Time is low (2-3 seconds quick rinse), watch it rise.

This is why 20 seconds matters. Every second is more soap molecules
getting to work.

Semmelweis was right. Your model proves it.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Fun Fact (Career Connection)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🦠 CAREER CONNECTION: PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIST / VIROLOGIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Public Health Scientists study how diseases spread through populations
and design interventions to stop them — including handwashing campaigns
that have saved millions of lives. During COVID-19, public health
scientists modeled exactly what you did today: understanding virus
survival rates under different conditions and communicating that
knowledge to the public.

Virologists study viruses specifically — how they replicate, how
they infect cells, and how we can stop them. Understanding the lipid
membrane structure you modeled today is central to antiviral drug
design and vaccine development.

💰 SALARY: $70,000 - $115,000 per year

During pandemics, virologists and public health scientists are on
the front lines of protecting society. The chemistry you modeled today
— soap molecules disrupting virus membranes — is the foundational
science they build on.

TEACHER GUIDE: How Soap Actually Destroys Viruses
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
This lesson transforms the ordinary act of handwashing into a
fascinating chemical story, increasing students' understanding of
both substance mixing (5-PS1-4) and public health science. The
Semmelweis story provides historical context, a lesson about
scientific courage, and a connection to real lives. Students leave
genuinely understanding WHY handwashing works — making them more
likely to actually do it properly.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
5-PS1-4: Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing
of two or more substances results in new substances.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 40-45 minutes (or split across 2 days)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Optional: show a short video of soap molecules attacking a lipid membrane (many exist on YouTube)
□ Optional: have a bottle of soap and water to demonstrate how soap behaves differently in water vs. dry
□ Review vocabulary: lipid, membrane, amphiphilic, concentration, virus

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Soap just washes bacteria/viruses down the drain" → Soap DESTROYS many viruses
  by disrupting their membranes; they don't just get rinsed away intact
• "Water alone is enough" → Water is good for physical removal but can't disrupt
  lipid membranes without soap molecules
• "Hand sanitizer and soap work the same way" → Different mechanisms; soap is
  generally more effective for most viruses (FDA conclusion)
• "Antibacterial soap is better for viruses" → Antibacterial chemicals target
  bacteria, not viruses; regular soap is equally effective against viruses

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: The "molecular demolition" framing is very engaging for 5th graders.
  Ask them what demolition equipment the soap molecule is like.
• Activity 2: Make sure students understand why the Soap Effectiveness → Virus Survival
  relationship is NEGATIVE — it's counterintuitive that "more effective" leads to "less survival."
• Activity 3: The three-scenario comparison is the most powerful moment. Run all three
  side by side if possible for class discussion.
• Activity 4: The Semmelweis story is excellent for discussing scientific courage,
  institutional resistance to change, and how lives can be lost when good science is ignored.

DISCUSSION PROMPTS:
• "If handwashing saves a million children per year, why don't all people have access to soap?"
• "What would you tell Ignaz Semmelweis if you could go back in time?"
• "Is hand sanitizer 'better' than soap? In what situations?"
• "Why do you think some people don't wash their hands even knowing the science?"

EXTENSION CONNECTIONS:
• Conservation of matter → What happens to virus particles after they're destroyed?
• Public health → How handwashing campaigns are designed and implemented
• Social justice → Access to clean water and soap as a health equity issue

ASSESSMENT:
• Can student explain the mechanism of soap (not just "it cleans")?
• Does student correctly identify the negative relationship as central to the model?
• Did student correctly predict that water only has minimal impact on virus survival?

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support: Provide diagram of soap molecule structure and how it attacks a lipid membrane
Challenge: Research enveloped vs. non-enveloped viruses; model the difference in soap effectiveness
ELL: Use molecular diagrams with arrows; the visual nature of soap molecule attacking a membrane crosses language barriers
