### Title
**Why Hurricanes Are Getting Angrier — The Science Behind Supercharged Storms**

### Overview
Hurricanes are the most powerful weather events on Earth. A single hurricane can release energy equivalent to 10,000 nuclear bombs. Understanding the science behind their formation and intensification is critical as climate change alters ocean temperatures. Students investigate the driving question: Why are hurricanes getting stronger and more destructive? Using the LEVER framework, students identify key components, establish cause-and-effect relationships, run simulations to test scenarios, and extend their understanding through research and engineering challenges.

WHY HURRICANES ARE GETTING ANGRIER

The Science Behind Supercharged Storms.
Why are hurricanes getting stronger and more destructive?

That's not just a question — it's something you can MODEL.
And you're about to build exactly that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR COMPONENTS
• Look at the component panel on the RIGHT side of your screen
• Find the EXTERNAL components (things we can't control):
  ○ Click "Sea Surface Temperature" — temperature of the ocean surface where the hurricane forms
  ○ Click "Atmospheric Moisture" — amount of water vapor available in the air
• Find the INTERNAL components (things that change because of other things):
  ○ Click "Hurricane Wind Speed" — maximum sustained wind speed of the storm
  ○ Click "Storm Surge Height" — height of ocean water pushed onto shore by the storm

STEP 2: ADD TO YOUR MODEL
• Click the PLUS (+) button to add each component to your picture
• You should now see 4 components on your canvas

STEP 3: SORT YOUR COMPONENTS
• Sort your components into EXTERNAL and INTERNAL
• EXTERNAL = things we can't control (inputs from outside the system)
• INTERNAL = things that change because of other things in the system
• Your teacher will show you how this works in the video

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You now have the basic pieces of your system.
But pieces alone don't explain anything — next, we connect them.

### Video Script

"Why are hurricanes getting stronger and more destructive?

That's what we're going to figure out today. Not by reading about
it — by MODELING it. You're going to build a system that shows
exactly how this works.

Let's build our system. Look at the component panel on the right
side of your screen. You'll see two types of components:

EXTERNAL components — things that come from outside the system.
Inputs we can't directly control.

INTERNAL components — things that change BECAUSE of other things
in the system. They respond to the externals.

Click on 'Sea Surface Temperature' — that's external. Temperature of the ocean surface where the hurricane forms.
Click on 'Atmospheric Moisture' — that's external. Amount of water vapor available in the air.
Click on 'Hurricane Wind Speed' — that's internal. Maximum sustained wind speed of the storm.
Click on 'Storm Surge Height' — that's internal. Height of ocean water pushed onto shore by the storm.

Now you need to SORT them. Which ones are external — things that
come from outside the system? Which ones are internal — things
that change because of what's happening inside?

Sea Surface Temperature and Atmospheric Moisture are external because they represent environmental conditions that exist before the hurricane forms. Hurricane Wind Speed and Storm Surge Height are internal because they are outputs produced by the storm system itself.

Sort your components, then hit the PLUS button to add each one
to your model canvas.

You've got your pieces. But right now they're just sitting there,
not connected. In the next activity, we'll draw the invisible
lines that show how everything affects everything else.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

## Activity 2: ESTABLISH — Connect the Relationships

### Text Editor

```
TIME TO DRAW THE INVISIBLE LINES

Those 4 components don't just sit there — they AFFECT each other.
When one changes, others change too. Let's map those connections.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: OPEN CONNECTION MODE
• Click the "Connect" icon in the TOP LEFT corner of your screen
• Your cursor is now ready to draw relationship arrows

STEP 2: DRAW YOUR RELATIONSHIPS
• Click on "Sea Surface Temperature" and drag an arrow to "Hurricane Wind Speed"
• Click on "Atmospheric Moisture" and drag an arrow to "Hurricane Wind Speed"
• Click on "Hurricane Wind Speed" and drag an arrow to "Storm Surge Height"

STEP 3: SET POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
• Look at the +/− toggle in the TOP LEFT corner
• For each connection, ask: "When this goes UP, does the other go UP or DOWN?"

  ○ Sea Surface Temperature → Hurricane Wind Speed = POSITIVE (+)
    Warmer water evaporates more, providing more energy through latent heat to fuel stronger winds.

  ○ Atmospheric Moisture → Hurricane Wind Speed = POSITIVE (+)
    More moisture means more condensation, which releases more latent heat to power the storm.

  ○ Hurricane Wind Speed → Storm Surge Height = POSITIVE (+)
    Stronger winds push more ocean water onto shore, creating higher and more destructive storm surges.

STEP 4: CHECK YOUR MODEL
• You should have 3 arrows total
• 0 negative relationship(s), 3 positive relationship(s)
• This is your system model!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THINK ABOUT IT: When sea surface temperature increases, what do you think happens to the amount of energy available to fuel a hurricane?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your pieces are on the board, but they're not talking to each
other yet. Time to draw the invisible lines — the relationships
that make this a SYSTEM, not just a pile of parts.

Click the 'Connect' icon in the top left corner. Now you're in
connection mode.

First connection: Click on 'Sea Surface Temperature' and drag an arrow
over to 'Hurricane Wind Speed.'

Here's the key question: When sea surface temperature goes UP, does
hurricane wind speed go UP or DOWN?

Warmer water evaporates more, providing more energy through latent heat to fuel stronger winds.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Next connection: Click on 'Atmospheric Moisture' and drag an arrow
over to 'Hurricane Wind Speed.'

Here's the key question: When atmospheric moisture goes UP, does
hurricane wind speed go UP or DOWN?

More moisture means more condensation, which releases more latent heat to power the storm.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Last connection: Click on 'Hurricane Wind Speed' and drag an arrow
over to 'Storm Surge Height.'

Here's the key question: When hurricane wind speed goes UP, does
storm surge height go UP or DOWN?

Stronger winds push more ocean water onto shore, creating higher and more destructive storm surges.
That's a POSITIVE relationship. They move in the same
direction. Click the plus sign.

Look at your model now. You've got 0 negative and 3
positive relationships. 3 arrows total.

When sea surface temperature increases, what do you think happens to the amount of energy available to fuel a hurricane?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TIME TO SEE YOUR SYSTEM IN ACTION

You built it. You connected it. Now let's see if it actually WORKS
like the real world.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: RUN THE SIMULATION
• Click the "Play" button in the TOP LEFT corner
• Watch the graph panel — you'll see percentage lines for each component

STEP 2: OBSERVE THE BASELINE
• Let it run for about 30 time steps
• Notice how the lines relate to each other
• When Sea Surface Temperature is HIGH, what happens to the internal components?

STEP 3: SCENARIO — CATEGORY 1 STORM
• Normal warm ocean temperature, moderate moisture
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Hurricane Wind Speed?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 4: SCENARIO — SUPERCHARGED STORM
• Lock Sea Surface Temperature to 90°F
• PREDICT FIRST: What do you predict will happen to Storm Surge Height?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

STEP 5: SCENARIO — COOL WATER ENCOUNTER
• Drop temperature from 90°F to 75°F
• PREDICT FIRST: What happens to the hurricane's intensity?
• Resume the simulation and observe what happens
• Was your prediction correct?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER?
• Hurricanes are heat engines — warm ocean water is their fuel
• Just a few degrees of extra ocean warmth dramatically increases storm intensity
• Rapid intensification is becoming more common as oceans warm
• When hurricanes hit cool water or land, they lose their energy source and weaken

THE ANSWER: Warmer ocean water provides more energy for hurricanes through evaporation and convection. As climate change heats the oceans, hurricanes have more fuel to intensify rapidly and produce devastating storm surges!
```

### Video Script

```
"You've built the machine. You've wired the connections. Now let's
flip the switch and see if your model matches reality.

Click the 'Play' button in the top left. Watch the graph panel —
you'll see lines representing each component as a percentage.

Let it run. Watch how the components interact at baseline levels.
Everything should be balanced, moving together.

First scenario: Category 1 Storm. Normal warm ocean temperature, moderate moisture.
Watch the graph. What do you see happening?

Now let's push the system. Scenario two: Supercharged Storm.
Lock Sea Surface Temperature to 90°F.

Before you run it — make a prediction. What do you predict will happen to Storm Surge Height?

Resume the simulation and watch what happens. Did your prediction
match the model? If not, that's actually a GOOD thing — it means
you learned something unexpected.

One more scenario: Cool Water Encounter. Drop temperature from 90°F to 75°F.
What happens to the hurricane's intensity?

Here's what our model reveals: Warmer ocean water provides more energy for hurricanes through evaporation and convection. As climate change heats the oceans, hurricanes have more fuel to intensify rapidly and produce devastating storm surges!

You just used a computational model to explain a real-world
phenomenon. That's what scientists do every day.

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

### Text Editor

```
YOUR MODEL WORKS — BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE

You built a system model. It explains the basics. But real
systems involve WAY more factors.

Time to play, explore, and make your model BETTER.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLAY TIME CHALLENGES:

1. TELL THE STORY
   • Run your simulation
   • Pretend you're a scientist presenting your findings
   • Explain what's happening and WHY to your partner

2. BREAK THE SYSTEM
   • What happens if you turn OFF Sea Surface Temperature?
   • What happens if you turn OFF Atmospheric Moisture?
   • What happens if you change multiple variables at once?
   • Can you find a combination where the system stays stable?

3. WHAT'S MISSING?
   Your model is simple. Real systems involve more. Think about:

   • Wind Shear — Strong winds at different altitudes that can tear apart hurricanes
   • Rainfall Intensity — Amount of rain the storm produces, linked to moisture
   • Coastal Population Density — Number of people in the storm's path, affecting damage

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:

Don't just guess — find out! Here's what to look for:

📚 IN YOUR TEXTBOOK:
   • Hurricane Formation — how does this connect to your model?
   • The Energy Connection — how does this connect to your model?

🔍 QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
   • Why is a Category 5 hurricane over warm water more dangerous than one over cool water?
   • How does the concept of 'rapid intensification' make hurricane forecasting harder?
   • If ocean temperatures continue to rise, what does your model predict for future storms?
   • Why do hurricanes weaken when they hit land?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ADD TO YOUR MODEL:
   • Pick ONE new component from your research
   • Decide: Is it INTERNAL or EXTERNAL?
   • Add it to your model (Plus button)
   • Connect it with relationships (+/−)
   • Run the simulation — does it work like you expected?

What story does your NEW model tell?
```

### Video Script

```
"Your model works. It showed us how the key components interact
and why things happen the way they do. But you and I both know
this isn't the whole story.

Real systems are way more complicated. So now it's time to PLAY,
QUESTION, and EXPAND.

First — tell the story. Run your simulation and pretend you're
a scientist presenting your findings at a conference. Explain
what's happening and WHY to someone next to you. If you can
explain it, you understand it.

Second — break the system. Change the variables. Turn things
on and off. What combinations create extreme results? What
keeps things stable? This is where real insight happens.

Third — and this is the big one — ask what's MISSING.

Your model has 4 components. Real systems involve
way more. Think about...

Wind Shear. Strong winds at different altitudes that can tear apart hurricanes
How would you model that?

Rainfall Intensity. Amount of rain the storm produces, linked to moisture
How would you model that?

Coastal Population Density. Number of people in the storm's path, affecting damage
How would you model that?

Here's your mission: Research ONE new factor. Find out how it
actually works in the real world. Then add it to your model.

Is it internal or external? Click the plus button to add it.
Draw the connections. Set positive or negative. Run the simulation.

Does your new model match reality better than before?

This is how real scientists work. Start simple. Test it. Add
complexity. Test again. Your model is never 'done' — it's
always getting better.

What story will YOUR expanded model tell?

Now it's your turn to ModelIt!"

TEACHER GUIDE: Why Hurricanes Are Getting Angrier
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON PURPOSE:
Hurricanes are the most powerful weather events on Earth. A single hurricane can release energy equivalent to 10,000 nuclear bombs. Understanding the science behind their formation and intensification is critical as climate change alters ocean temperatures.

NGSS ALIGNMENT:
MS-ESS2-5, MS-ESS2-6: Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses results in changes in weather conditions. Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating of the Earth causes patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING:
• Science Practice: Developing and Using Models
  Students develop a model showing how ocean temperature and atmospheric conditions determine hurricane intensity.
• Disciplinary Core Idea: ESS2.D Weather and Climate
  Complex interactions of air masses, ocean temperatures, and atmospheric conditions drive weather patterns.
• Crosscutting Concept: Energy and Matter
  Students trace the flow of thermal energy from ocean water through evaporation into the kinetic energy of hurricane winds.

PACING GUIDE:
• Activity 1 (Locate): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 2 (Establish): 8-10 minutes
• Activity 3 (Visualize & Evaluate): 10-12 minutes
• Activity 4 (Revise & Extend): 10-15 minutes
• Total: 50-70 minutes (or split across 2 class periods)

PRE-LESSON PREP:
□ Test ModelIt access on student devices
□ Review vocabulary: Sea Surface Temperature, Rapid Intensification, Storm Surge, Convection
□ Prepare Why are hurricanes getting stronger and more destructive discussion hook
□ Have images or video ready for phenomenon introduction

LEVER FRAMEWORK:
• Locate: Students identify sea surface temperature, atmospheric moisture, hurricane wind speed, and storm surge height as system components.
• Establish: Students determine that warmer water and more moisture both increase wind speed (positive), and wind speed increases storm surge (positive).
• Visualize: Students build the hurricane model showing how ocean heat translates to storm intensity.
• Evaluate: Students compare normal, supercharged, and cool water scenarios to see the energy relationship.
• Revise: Students add wind shear or coastal population to explore additional factors.

BACKGROUND CONTENT:
• Hurricane Formation:
  Hurricanes form over warm ocean water (above 80°F/26.5°C). Warm water evaporates, and the moist air rises rapidly through convection. As it rises, it cools and condenses, releasing latent heat that further fuels the rising air. The Coriolis effect from Earth's rotation causes the system to spin.

• The Energy Connection:
  A hurricane is essentially a heat engine. The warmer the ocean surface, the more water evaporates, and the more energy is available to fuel the storm. The relationship between sea surface temperature and maximum potential hurricane intensity is well-established in atmospheric science.

• Rapid Intensification:
  Rapid intensification occurs when a hurricane's maximum sustained winds increase by 35+ mph in 24 hours. Hurricane Patricia (2015) went from tropical storm to Category 5 in just 24 hours. Studies show RI events have increased in frequency as oceans warm, making hurricanes harder to forecast and evacuate for.

• Climate Change Connection:
  Global average sea surface temperatures have risen about 1.5°F since 1900. The proportion of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased significantly since 1980. Climate models predict continued intensification as oceans absorb more heat, with the strongest storms getting even stronger.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Hurricanes are getting more frequent"
  Reality: The total NUMBER of hurricanes hasn't clearly increased, but the PROPORTION of intense storms (Category 4-5) has increased significantly. Fewer storms, but the ones that form are stronger.
  Strategy: Show data comparing total hurricane counts vs. major hurricane counts over time.

• "Wind is the most dangerous part"
  Reality: Storm surge actually causes the most deaths and property damage during hurricanes. A 15-foot wall of ocean water pushed inland is more destructive than wind alone.
  Strategy: Show storm surge vs. wind damage statistics from recent hurricanes.

• "Climate change creates hurricanes"
  Reality: Climate change doesn't CREATE hurricanes — they've always existed. But warmer oceans provide more FUEL for storms that do form, making them stronger and more likely to rapidly intensify.
  Strategy: Analogy: A bigger gas tank doesn't start the car, but it lets the engine run harder and longer.

FACILITATION TIPS:
• Activity 1: Let students explore the interface. Don't over-explain.
  Let them discover. Circulate and support, don't lecture.
• Activity 2: Ask "When this goes up, what happens to that?" to
  guide positive/negative relationship decisions. Let students debate.
• Activity 3: Give time for students to "break" the model — turn
  things on/off and observe. This is where real insight happens.
• Activity 4: Don't give answers. Ask questions. Let curiosity drive
  the research. Celebrate when students' additions don't work as
  expected — that's authentic science.

ANSWER KEY:
Big Question: Why are hurricanes getting stronger and more destructive?
Answer: Warmer ocean water provides more energy for hurricanes through evaporation and convection. As climate change heats the oceans, hurricanes have more fuel to intensify rapidly and produce devastating storm surges!

Simulation Answers:
• Supercharged Storm Scenario: At 90°F sea surface temperature, Hurricane Wind Speed rapidly increases as the abundant warm water provides massive energy through evaporation. Storm Surge Height climbs proportionally. The storm intensifies much faster than at lower temperatures.
• Cool Water Encounter: When temperature drops to 75°F, the hurricane's energy source is cut off. Wind speed decreases rapidly as the storm can no longer sustain itself. Storm surge drops accordingly. This is why hurricanes weaken over land — no warm water fuel.

Reflection Exemplars:
• Q: Why does rapid intensification make forecasting harder?
  A: If a storm can go from Category 1 to Category 5 in 24 hours, there may not be enough time to issue warnings and evacuate. Traditional forecasting assumes more gradual changes. Rapid intensification is essentially 'surprise strength' that catches communities off guard.
• Q: Should people build in hurricane zones?
  A: This is a complex question involving risk assessment, economics, and equity. Many coastal communities have existed for centuries. The key is building WITH hurricane awareness: elevated structures, storm-resistant designs, robust evacuation plans, and acknowledging that stronger storms are coming.

STEM CHALLENGE GUIDANCE:
Title: Design a Hurricane-Resilient Community
Mission: Design a coastal community plan that can withstand Category 5 hurricanes based on what your model reveals about storm behavior.
Scenario: A coastal city that experienced a devastating hurricane has hired your team to redesign their community to survive future storms that may be even stronger.
Introduction: Show footage of a recent devastating hurricane. Present the challenge: The city needs to be rebuilt, but the next storm could be even stronger. What does your model tell you about the future?

Key Concepts:
• Building Codes: Stricter construction standards that require hurricane-resistant design features.
• Natural Barriers: Mangroves, sand dunes, and wetlands that absorb storm surge energy.
• Elevation Design: Building critical infrastructure above predicted storm surge heights.

Evaluation Rubric:
• Expert (4): Design addresses multiple hazards (wind, surge, flooding), uses model evidence for future projections, and includes practical details
• Proficient (3): Design uses model data and addresses at least two hurricane hazards
• Developing (2): Design mentions hurricane protection but lacks specific evidence from model
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to hurricane science or model findings

DIFFERENTIATION:
Support (Struggling Learners):
  • Provide a diagram showing how warm water fuels hurricane formation
  • Use a pan of warm water and a fan to demonstrate convection currents
  • Sentence frames: 'When sea surface temperature increases, hurricane wind speed __ because __'

Extensions (Advanced Learners):
  • Research and graph the increase in Category 4-5 hurricanes over the past 40 years
  • Add wind shear component and model why some storms weaken unexpectedly
  • Compare hurricane tracks and intensities from the 1970s vs. 2020s

Cross-Curricular Connections:
  • Math: Calculate and graph the relationship between sea surface temperature and maximum wind speed
  • ELA: Write a breaking news story about a rapidly intensifying hurricane making landfall
  • Social Studies: Research how hurricane damage disproportionately affects low-income communities

CAST ALIGNMENT:
• Explain how air mass interactions create weather patterns
• Use models to describe how unequal heating drives atmospheric circulation
• Collect and analyze data about weather conditions and climate patterns

CAST-Style Assessment Questions:
• Multiple Choice: Sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico rise from 82°F to 88°F. A tropical storm enters this region. What is the most likely result?
• Constructed Response: Using your model, explain the chain of events from warm ocean water to destructive storm surge in a coastal city.

MISSION: Design a coastal community plan that can withstand Category 5 hurricanes based on what your model reveals about storm behavior.

SCENARIO: A coastal city that experienced a devastating hurricane has hired your team to redesign their community to survive future storms that may be even stronger.

GUIDING QUESTIONS:
• Based on your model, how strong could future hurricanes become?
• What is the most destructive element of a hurricane — wind or water?
• How can building design reduce hurricane damage?

DESIGN THINKING:
• Where should buildings be located relative to the coast?

  _________________________________________________________

• What building materials and designs resist hurricane forces?

  _________________________________________________________

• How will you protect against storm surge flooding?

  _________________________________________________________

• What emergency systems does your community need?

  _________________________________________________________


EVALUATION RUBRIC:
• Expert (4): Design addresses multiple hazards (wind, surge, flooding), uses model evidence for future projections, and includes practical details
• Proficient (3): Design uses model data and addresses at least two hurricane hazards
• Developing (2): Design mentions hurricane protection but lacks specific evidence from model
• Beginning (1): Design doesn't connect to hurricane science or model findings
