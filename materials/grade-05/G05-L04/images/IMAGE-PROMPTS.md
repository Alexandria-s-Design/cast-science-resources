## Image 1: cover-water-distribution.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a dramatic overhead view of Earth from space showing the blue ocean dominating, with a tiny isolated bright blue water droplet floating above it labeled with a small '1%' tag. Several 5th grade students stand on a classroom-scale model of Earth looking up at the droplet in surprise"

## Image 2: water-cycle-evaporation.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a parched cracked desert landscape with heat shimmer visible, while a small blue water droplet rises from a puddle as vapor toward the hot sky. The split effect shows what the water looks like underground — a small pocket of groundwater below the dry surface"

## Image 3: students-water-discussion.png
**Prompt Insert:** "three 5th grade students huddled around a large printed pie chart showing Earth's water distribution — 97% ocean, 2% glaciers, 1% fresh. One student traces the tiny slice with a finger, looking shocked. Classroom setting with globe visible"

## Image 4: student-modeling-water.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a 5th grade student at a laptop viewing a simulation graph with multiple colored lines tracking precipitation, evaporation, and water availability. One line is dropping toward zero while the student watches with a concerned expression. Science classroom, good lighting"

## Image 5: cape-town-water-crisis.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a scene showing a water conservation sign and a partially empty reservoir in a drought-affected region, with a group of diverse students examining a map showing water resources. One student is making notes. The students look engaged and problem-solving. Outdoor field study setting"
