## Image 1: cover-scale-ice-water.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a clear glass containing an ice cube sitting on a digital kitchen scale showing '200g.' Next to it, the same glass now full of liquid water with the scale still showing exactly '200g.' A 5th grade student stands between the two glasses with a delighted, slightly mind-blown expression"

## Image 2: ice-melting-close-up.png
**Prompt Insert:** "an extreme close-up time-lapse showing an ice cube melting into water, with tiny water droplets around the edges showing the transition. Visible water molecules in a subtle overlay showing them moving from tight crystal structure to flowing liquid. Clean white laboratory-style background"

## Image 3: students-matter-investigation.png
**Prompt Insert:** "two 5th grade students conducting a hands-on investigation with ice cubes, graduated cylinders, and a scale. One student records observations in a lab notebook while the other holds up a melting ice cube over a container. Science classroom with lab tables, proper lab safety setup"

## Image 4: student-modeling-states.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a 5th grade student at a computer viewing a ModelIt simulation with three lines on a graph: one for ice amount, one for water amount, and one flat line for total mass. The student points at the screen where the two curved lines form a perfect mirror image while the flat mass line stays constant"

## Image 5: states-of-matter-comparison.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a split-panel display showing ice, water, and steam side by side with a scale under each showing the same mass for all three states. Three 5th grade students each stand next to one panel, making notes and comparing. Clean science classroom setting with periodic table visible in background"
