## Image 1: cover-wood-wide-web.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a dramatic split-level forest scene: above ground shows tall trees in dappled sunlight; below the soil line shows a glowing golden network of mycorrhizal fungal threads connecting all the root systems like fiber optic cables. Several diverse 5th grade students peer through a 'window' cut in the earth's surface, faces lit with amazement at the glowing network below"

## Image 2: mushroom-mycelium-closeup.png
**Prompt Insert:** "an extreme close-up macro photograph of white fungal mycelium threads (hyphae) spreading through rich dark forest soil around tree roots, with tiny nutrient particles visible along the threads. The image has a magical quality — the threads glow faintly. Natural forest setting, soft lighting"

## Image 3: students-forest-network-discussion.png
**Prompt Insert:** "three 5th grade students in a forest setting, kneeling by a tree's base and examining soil carefully. One student holds a diagram showing the tree-fungi connection network. Another student has a magnifying glass examining mycelium on a piece of bark. Natural forest setting, engaged and curious expressions"

## Image 4: student-modeling-network.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a 5th grade student at a computer viewing a network simulation with nodes labeled 'Organic Matter,' 'Soil Moisture,' 'Fungal Network,' and 'Nutrient Transfer' connected by arrows. The graph shows all four lines active and climbing. Focused expression. Science classroom"

## Image 5: forest-restoration.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a diverse group of 5th grade students planting young saplings in a forest restoration project, with a scientist adult guide explaining something about the root systems. The students look purposeful and proud. Partially replanted forest setting with both new saplings and older trees visible"
