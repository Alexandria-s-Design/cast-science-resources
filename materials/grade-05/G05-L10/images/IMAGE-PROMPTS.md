## Image 1: cover-stargazing-time-machine.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a group of diverse 5th grade students lying on blankets on a hillside at night, looking up at a brilliantly star-filled sky. Subtle text overlays near specific stars show light travel times: '4 light years,' '430 light years,' '700 light years.' One student points upward with an expression of genuine existential awe. The Milky Way is visible overhead. Warm, safe, wonder-filled setting"

## Image 2: star-brightness-comparison.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a dramatic split-panel showing the sun (small, nearby, overwhelmingly bright) versus a massive blue supergiant star shown at great distance (huge but appearing dim). Arrows indicate the distance. Three 5th grade students compare the two panels on a large science room display, expressing surprise at the counterintuitive results"

## Image 3: hubble-deep-field.png
**Prompt Insert:** "two 5th grade students in a planetarium or science museum, looking up at a giant projection of a deep space image showing thousands of galaxies. One student's mouth is slightly open in awe. The galaxies glow in beautiful colors. A small information plaque reads 'Each point of light: a galaxy of 100 billion stars.' The students look small against the scale of the universe"

## Image 4: student-modeling-starlight.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a 5th grade student at a computer viewing a star simulation with four component lines on a graph — Distance, Luminosity, Light Travel Time, and Apparent Brightness. The student is adjusting a slider for 'Star Distance' and watching Apparent Brightness change in real time. Focused and engaged. Classroom setting with star posters on the wall"

## Image 5: astronomer-career.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a young Black male astronomer in a professional observatory control room, surrounded by multiple screens showing spectral data, star maps, and telescope feeds. He is engaged and in command of his workspace. The setting conveys both intellectual rigor and wonder. Slightly dramatic lighting from the screens"
