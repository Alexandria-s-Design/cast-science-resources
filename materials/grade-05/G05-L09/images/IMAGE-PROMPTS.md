## Image 1: cover-freeway-community.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a powerful split view: on one side, a busy urban freeway with visible exhaust and trucks; on the other side, a diverse group of 5th grade students in a classroom near a freeway window, looking thoughtfully outside. A subtle hazy connection links the two scenes. The students look serious but empowered — like they understand what's happening and are ready to do something about it"
