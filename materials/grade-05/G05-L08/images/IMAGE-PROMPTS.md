## Image 1: cover-soap-virus-destruction.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a close-up of young hands being washed under running water with soap bubbles, with a small microscopic inset panel in the corner showing a colorful virus with an intact membrane — and next to it, the same virus with its membrane shattering apart as soap molecules attack it. The overall image is dynamic and slightly dramatic. Clean bathroom or school sink setting"

## Image 2: soap-molecule-diagram.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a clean educational-style 3D illustration of an amphiphilic soap molecule with its water-loving head and oil-loving tail clearly visible, shown attacking a spherical virus's lipid membrane. The molecule is colorful and clear. Background shows a school science classroom poster style. Two 5th grade students stand beside it studying it"

## Image 3: students-handwashing-science.png
**Prompt Insert:** "two 5th grade students at a science lab sink conducting a handwashing experiment — one washing with soap and water, one washing with water only. A third student observes and takes notes on results. The setting has a visible lab setup with petri dishes and data chart on the table. Engaged, scientific expressions"

## Image 4: student-modeling-handwashing.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a 5th grade student viewing a simulation graph on a laptop showing three scenario lines: 'Water Only' (Virus Survival staying high), 'Soap Only' (moderate drop), and 'Soap + Water' (Virus Survival dropping near zero). The student has a satisfied, 'I understand this now' expression. Science classroom"
