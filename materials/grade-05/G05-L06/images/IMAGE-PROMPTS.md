## Image 1: cover-tree-from-air.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a towering giant sequoia tree with a subtle x-ray effect revealing glowing CO2 molecule streams flowing from the air into its leaves and trunk, visually building the wood. The tree is shown as partially transparent on one side revealing this process. Several diverse 5th grade students stand at the base looking up in wonder"

## Image 2: leaf-photosynthesis.png
**Prompt Insert:** "an extreme close-up of a leaf's surface with sunlight streaming through it, showing the cellular structure. Small glowing CO2 molecule labels enter through tiny stomata pores. Oxygen bubbles exit. The overall effect is magical and scientific — showing the factory inside the leaf"

## Image 3: van-helmont-experiment.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a modern recreation of the van Helmont experiment: a student stands next to a small willow tree in a large pot on a scale. The student holds a sign showing 'After 5 years: tree +164 lbs, soil -2 oz.' The student looks thoughtfully at the scale. School garden setting with other trees visible"

## Image 4: student-modeling-photosynthesis.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a 5th grade student at a computer running a plant growth simulation, watching a graph where 'Tree Biomass' slowly climbs upward while CO2 and sunlight inputs are shown at their levels. The student looks focused and engaged. Science classroom setting"

## Image 5: greenhouse-agriculture.png
**Prompt Insert:** "a modern commercial greenhouse interior with rows of vibrant green plants growing under grow lights and CO2 injection tubes visible. Two diverse 5th grade students on a field trip observe with a scientist guide who gestures at the growing plants. High-tech, forward-looking setting"
