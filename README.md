## ModelIt K12 Alignment

[ModelIt K12](https://modelit.io) is a systems thinking and computational modeling platform designed for K–12 science education. Its simulation-based approach naturally aligns with CAST's three-dimensional assessment framework.

See: [docs/modelit-alignment.md](docs/modelit-alignment.md) for the detailed mapping.

### Strongest Alignment Areas

#### Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)
| SEP | CAST Relevance | ModelIt Capability |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| Developing and Using Models | Heavily assessed across all domains | Core platform feature — students build, test, and revise computational models |
| Analyzing and Interpreting Data | Key to performance tasks | Built-in data visualization, graphs, and analysis tools |
| Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking | Required for quantitative items | Computational modeling with variables, equations, and system dynamics |
| Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions | Central to constructed response items | Students explain model behavior and iterate on designs |
| Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | Assessed through simulation-based items | Virtual experiments with controlled variables |

#### Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)
| CCC | ModelIt Feature |
|-----|----------------|
| Systems and System Models | Foundational — all models are system representations |
| Cause and Effect | Students manipulate variables to observe causal relationships |
| Patterns | Data output reveals patterns in system behavior |
| Energy and Matter: Flows, Cycles, and Conservation | Stock-and-flow models track quantities through systems |
| Stability and Change | Models show equilibrium, feedback loops, and tipping points |

#### Best-Fit Performance Expectations

**Grade 5 — High alignment:**
- 5-LS2-1: Matter cycling (plants, animals, decomposers, environment)
- 5-ESS2-1: Geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere interactions
- 5-ESS3-1: Community science for resource protection
- 5-PS1-2: Conservation of matter (heating, cooling, mixing)

**Grade 8 — High alignment:**
- MS-LS2-3: Matter cycling and energy flow in ecosystems
- MS-ESS2-6: Unequal heating → atmospheric/oceanic circulation → climate
- MS-ESS3-4: Human population growth → impact on Earth's systems
- MS-PS1-5: Conservation of atoms in chemical reactions
- MS-LS1-6: Photosynthesis — matter cycling and energy flow
- MS-LS2-1: Resource availability → organism/population effects
