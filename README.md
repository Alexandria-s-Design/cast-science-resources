## What is the CAST?

The **California Science Test (CAST)** is a computer-based assessment aligned to the **California Next Generation Science Standards (CA NGSS)**. It measures student proficiency in science across three dimensions:

1. **Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)** — what students *do*
2. **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)** — what students *know*
3. **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)** — how students *connect ideas*
