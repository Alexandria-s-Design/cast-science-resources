# NGSS Design Badge Gap Analysis for ModelIt! Grade 5 Lessons

## What is the NGSS Design Badge?
- Issued by **NextGenScience (WestEd)** — the gold standard for NGSS-aligned curriculum
- Only **~4% of all reviewed units** earn the badge
- Requires the **highest rating on the EQuIP Rubric for Science** (19 criteria across 3 categories)
- Badge includes embedded, detailed reviewer feedback

## THE VERDICT: Your plans DO NOT need to change drastically.

ModelIt! lessons already have strong bones for NGSS alignment. The core structure (phenomenon-driven, modeling-based, LEVER framework) is fundamentally sound. However, there are **specific gaps** that need to be addressed to meet the EQuIP rubric's high bar.

---

## CATEGORY I: NGSS Design (6 criteria)

### I.A — Phenomenon-Driven Learning
**Current Status: MOSTLY ALIGNED (minor gaps)**
- STRENGTH: Each lesson IS anchored in a real phenomenon (California fires, decomposition, etc.)
- STRENGTH: Big Questions drive the investigation
- GAP: Lessons currently use phenomena partly as a "hook" then shift to activities. EQuIP requires students to **continuously return** to the phenomenon throughout the lesson, adding layers of explanation.
- GAP: Need more explicit support for teachers to **draw out student questions** about the phenomenon BEFORE teaching begins
- FIX: Add a "Notice & Wonder" protocol at the start of each lesson. Add a "Return to Phenomenon" moment after each activity where students revise their explanation.

### I.B — Three Dimensions (SEP + DCI + CCC)
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED (needs work)**
- STRENGTH: DCI (Disciplinary Core Ideas) are well-addressed in every lesson
- STRENGTH: SEP "Developing and Using Models" is the core practice
- GAP: **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs) are underdeveloped.** Current lessons mention CCCs in the Teacher's Guide but students don't explicitly USE them. EQuIP requires students to actively use CCC elements (e.g., "Cause & Effect", "Systems & System Models") as thinking tools.
- GAP: Only ONE SEP is deeply developed (modeling). EQuIP wants evidence of multiple SEPs being used.
- FIX: Add explicit CCC prompts to student activities (e.g., "Use CAUSE AND EFFECT thinking: When ___ increases, what effect does it have on ___?"). Add a second SEP like "Constructing Explanations" or "Engaging in Argument from Evidence."

### I.C — Integrating Three Dimensions
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- GAP: The three dimensions (SEP + DCI + CCC) need to be **used together** in student performances, not separately. Currently, students model (SEP) using science ideas (DCI) but don't explicitly integrate CCC thinking.
- FIX: Design assessment tasks where students must use all three dimensions simultaneously (e.g., "Use your model [SEP] to explain why decomposer activity decreases during drought [DCI] by identifying the cause-and-effect relationships [CCC] in the system").

### I.D — Unit Coherence
**Current Status: GAP**
- GAP: Current lessons are standalone. EQuIP requires a coherent **unit** where lessons build on each other. The badge is awarded to UNITS, not individual lessons.
- FIX: Group lessons into coherent units (e.g., L01+L02+L06+L07 = "Matter Cycling" unit). Create a unit storyline where each lesson's discoveries feed into the next lesson's questions.

### I.E — Multiple Science Domains
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- Some lessons naturally cross domains (L01 crosses Earth Science + Life Science)
- FIX: Make cross-domain connections explicit where they exist. This is not required for every lesson.

### I.F — Math and ELA Connections
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- STRENGTH: Cross-curricular connections exist in Teacher's Guide
- GAP: Need more explicit connection to Common Core Math and ELA standards
- FIX: Add specific CCSS-M and CCSS-ELA standard codes to the Teacher's Guide. Ensure students read at least 2 different text formats (articles, infographics, etc.).

---

## CATEGORY II: Instructional Supports (7 criteria)

### II.A — Relevance and Authenticity
**Current Status: MOSTLY ALIGNED (minor gaps)**
- STRENGTH: Phenomena are real-world and compelling (wildfires, air quality, decomposition)
- STRENGTH: STEM challenges connect to real careers
- GAP: Need more explicit **cultural connections** and support for teachers to connect to students' home/neighborhood/community
- FIX: Add "Local Connection" prompts (e.g., "Ask students: Has anyone experienced a wildfire or seen smoke from one? What was that like?")

### II.B — Student Ideas
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- STRENGTH: Pre-assessment captures initial ideas
- GAP: Need more structured opportunities for students to **share, compare, and revise** their ideas with peers throughout the lesson (not just at the end)
- FIX: Add "Turn & Talk" and "Gallery Walk" protocols. Add structured peer feedback moments.

### II.C — Building Progressions
**Current Status: GAP**
- GAP: No explicit connection to what students learned in prior grades or what comes next
- FIX: Add "Prior Learning" section to Teacher's Guide showing what students should already know from Grades 3-4. Add "Looking Ahead" showing how this connects to middle school standards.

### II.D — Scientific Accuracy
**Current Status: ALIGNED**
- Background content in Teacher's Guide is scientifically accurate

### II.E — Differentiated Instruction
**Current Status: MOSTLY ALIGNED**
- STRENGTH: Differentiation section exists in Teacher's Guide
- GAP: Need more specific scaffolds, not just general suggestions
- FIX: Add sentence frames, graphic organizers, and specific ELL supports

### II.F — Teacher Support for Unit Coherence
**Current Status: GAP (same as I.D)**
- Need unit-level teacher guidance showing the storyline

### II.G — Scaffolded Differentiation Over Time
**Current Status: GAP**
- GAP: Scaffolding should decrease over the course of a unit as students become more proficient
- FIX: Design early lessons with more scaffolding, later lessons with more student independence

---

## CATEGORY III: Monitoring Student Progress (5 criteria)

### III.A — Monitoring 3D Student Performances
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- GAP: Current assessments mostly check DCI understanding. Need assessments that measure all three dimensions integrated together.
- FIX: Add 3D assessment tasks where students demonstrate SEP + DCI + CCC together

### III.B — Formative Assessment
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- STRENGTH: Pre-assessment exists
- GAP: Need embedded formative checks DURING the lesson, not just before/after
- FIX: Add "checkpoint" questions after each activity that teachers can use to gauge understanding and adjust instruction

### III.C — Scoring Guidance
**Current Status: PARTIALLY ALIGNED**
- STRENGTH: Rubric exists
- GAP: Rubric needs to explicitly address all three dimensions, not just skills
- FIX: Revise rubric to score SEP, DCI, and CCC separately

### III.D — Unbiased Assessment
**Current Status: MOSTLY ALIGNED**
- GAP: Need explicit review that assessment language is accessible to all students including ELLs
- FIX: Review all assessment items for cultural bias and linguistic complexity

### III.E — Assessment Variety
**Current Status: MOSTLY ALIGNED**
- STRENGTH: Multiple assessment formats (written, drawing, discussion)
- GAP: Need more variety including student-driven artifacts

## WHAT STAYS THE SAME
- The LEVER framework is strong and maps well to NGSS practices
- Phenomenon-driven approach is fundamentally correct
- ModelIt! as a tool for "Developing and Using Models" (SEP) is excellent
- Image/visual quality and branding are not part of EQuIP review
- STEM challenges and career connections are valuable enrichment
- Teacher's Guide structure (8 sections) covers most needs

## ESTIMATED EFFORT
- **Lesson-level changes**: ~30% revision per lesson (add CCC prompts, formative checks, return-to-phenomenon, peer protocols)
- **Unit-level changes**: New work — need to create unit storylines and progression documents
- **Assessment changes**: ~40% revision (add 3D tasks, revise rubric)
- **Teacher's Guide**: ~20% additions (progressions, CCSS connections, formative guidance)

## BOTTOM LINE
Your core approach is sound. The biggest gap is that EQuIP reviews **UNITS** not individual lessons, so the 10 standalone lessons need to be organized into 2-3 coherent units with a storyline connecting them. The second biggest gap is explicit CCC integration — students need to USE crosscutting concepts as thinking tools, not just have them listed in the Teacher's Guide.
