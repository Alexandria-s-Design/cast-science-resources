## Foundation: The NRC Framework

All content is grounded in **A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas** (National Research Council, 2012), which established the three-dimensional learning approach adopted by NGSS and CA NGSS.

### The Three Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Is | Content Implication |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Science & Engineering Practices (SEPs)** | What students DO | Show students DOING science, not just learning facts |
| **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)** | How students CONNECT ideas | Explicitly name and reinforce connections across topics |
| **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)** | What students KNOW | Focus on deep understanding of core ideas, not breadth |

### Key NRC Principles for Content Development

1. **Learning is developmental** — Build on prior knowledge across grade bands
2. **Integration is essential** — All three dimensions work together, never in isolation
3. **Phenomena drive learning** — Start with real-world observations students can investigate
4. **Practices are not procedures** — Students should engage in authentic scientific thinking, not follow scripts
5. **Assessment matches instruction** — Students demonstrate understanding by applying all three dimensions

**Reference:** [A Framework for K-12 Science Education](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13165/a-framework-for-k-12-science-education-practices-crosscutting-concepts) (National Academies Press, 2012)

## Student-Facing Content

### The Brainchild Approach

Netflix's *Brainchild* succeeds because it treats young viewers as intelligent, curious people—not empty vessels to fill with facts. Our content follows the same philosophy.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Relatable, not condescending** | Talk WITH students, not AT them | "Ever wonder why..." not "Today you will learn..." |
| **Fun but substantive** | Entertainment serves learning, never replaces it | Jokes reinforce concepts, not distract from them |
| **Question-driven** | Start with genuine curiosity | "Why does this happen?" not "Here's a fact" |
| **Visual and active** | Show, don't just tell | Diagrams, animations, experiments |
| **Connected to their world** | Link science to things they care about | Social media, games, sports, food |

### Voice and Tone

**DO:**
- Use conversational language
- Ask questions they might actually wonder about
- Include humor that's clever (not silly or inappropriate)
- Acknowledge when things are weird, surprising, or counterintuitive
- Celebrate discovery and "aha!" moments
- Use "we" and "you" — inclusive language
- Be enthusiastic without being over-the-top

**DON'T:**
- Use textbook language or jargon without explanation
- Talk down to students
- Assume they don't know anything
- Make jokes that distract from the content
- Use sarcasm (it doesn't translate well)
- Be boring in the name of being "educational"
- Oversimplify to the point of being inaccurate

### Vocabulary Strategy

| Term Type | Approach | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Everyday words** | Use freely | "stuff," "things," "cool" |
| **Academic vocabulary** | Introduce naturally, define in context | "Scientists call this a *system*—basically, a group of parts that work together" |
| **Technical terms** | Use when necessary, always explain | "This is called *Boolean logic*—it just means ON or OFF, yes or no" |
| **NGSS language** | Translate to student-friendly terms | "Crosscutting concept" → "This big idea shows up everywhere in science" |

### Age-Appropriate Language

#### Grades PreK-2
- Short sentences (5-10 words)
- Concrete, observable language
- Lots of action verbs
- Questions they can answer from experience
- "The sun makes the plant grow!"

#### Grades 3-5
- Building sentence complexity
- Introduce cause-and-effect language
- Begin using "because" and "so that"
- Connect to their expanding world
- "When the sun shines on the plant, something cool happens..."

#### Grades 6-8
- More sophisticated vocabulary (with support)
- Abstract thinking invited
- Multiple perspectives considered
- Real-world applications emphasized
- "Here's where it gets interesting—the same pattern shows up in ecosystems, your body, AND social media algorithms..."

#### Grades 9-12
- Adult-level complexity with scaffolding
- Nuance and uncertainty acknowledged
- Career and real-world connections explicit
- Critical evaluation encouraged
- "Scientists are still debating this, but here's what the evidence suggests..."

## Teacher-Facing Content

### Design Philosophy

Teachers are busy professionals who may or may not have deep content expertise. Our materials should:

1. **Respect their time** — Get to the point quickly
2. **Build their confidence** — Don't assume they know everything
3. **Provide scaffolding** — Give them what they need to succeed
4. **Be practical** — Focus on what actually happens in classrooms
5. **Connect to standards** — Make alignment explicit and easy to document

### Voice and Tone

**DO:**
- Use clear, direct language
- Explain the "why" behind instructional choices
- Provide concrete examples and scripts
- Anticipate common questions and misconceptions
- Include time estimates and material lists
- Offer differentiation suggestions
- Be encouraging and supportive

**DON'T:**
- Use education jargon without explanation
- Assume deep content knowledge
- Provide activities without explaining their purpose
- Leave teachers to figure out the "how"
- Make materials that require extensive prep
- Forget that teachers have constraints (time, resources, class size)

### Unpacking Standards

Every teacher guide should include clear standard unpacking:

#### Standard Unpacking Template

```
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATION: [Code and full text]

WHAT THIS MEANS:
[2-3 sentence plain-language explanation]

WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO:
• [Observable behavior 1]
• [Observable behavior 2]
• [Observable behavior 3]

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• [Misconception 1] → [Correction]
• [Misconception 2] → [Correction]

CONNECTIONS TO PRIOR LEARNING:
• [What students should already know]

CONNECTIONS TO FUTURE LEARNING:
• [Where this leads]
```

#### Example Unpacking

```
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATION: 5-LS2-1
Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants,
animals, decomposers, and the environment.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
Students create a visual representation showing how matter (atoms,
molecules) moves in a cycle between living things and their
environment. The key insight is that matter is NOT created or
destroyed—it just moves around.

WHAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO:
• Draw or build a model showing matter cycling
• Trace the path of a carbon atom through the cycle
• Explain that the same atoms get reused over and over
• Identify the role of decomposers in returning matter to soil/air

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:
• "Plants get food from soil" → Plants make their own food from
  air (CO2) and water; they get minerals from soil
• "Dead things just disappear" → Decomposers break them down
  and release matter back into the environment
• "Matter is used up" → Matter cycles—the same atoms get reused

CONNECTIONS TO PRIOR LEARNING:
• 2-LS2-1: Plants need water and light
• 4-LS1-1: Plants and animals have structures for survival

CONNECTIONS TO FUTURE LEARNING:
• MS-LS2-3: More detailed matter/energy cycling
• HS-LS2-4: Mathematical representations of cycling
```

### Facilitation Language

Teachers need practical language for guiding discussions. Provide scripted prompts:

#### Discussion Starters
- "What do you notice about...?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "Turn to your partner and share..."
- "Who can add to what [student] said?"
- "What evidence supports that idea?"

#### Redirecting Misconceptions
- "That's a common idea. Let's test it..."
- "Interesting! What would we expect to see if that were true?"
- "Let's look at the evidence together..."
- "Many scientists used to think that too, until..."

#### Encouraging Deeper Thinking
- "Say more about that..."
- "How does that connect to what we saw earlier?"
- "What would happen if we changed...?"
- "How could we test that idea?"

## Video Script Guidelines

### Structure Template (5-7 minutes)

```
[0:00-0:30] HOOK
- Surprising fact, question, or visual
- "Have you ever wondered...?"
- Immediate engagement

[0:30-1:30] PHENOMENON INTRODUCTION
- Present the real-world observation
- Make it relatable to students' lives
- "Here's something weird/cool/surprising..."

[1:30-3:30] INVESTIGATION/EXPLORATION
- Walk through the thinking process
- Include visuals, animations, or demonstrations
- "Let's figure this out together..."

[3:30-5:00] EXPLANATION
- Connect to the science concept
- Use analogies and comparisons
- "So here's what's actually happening..."

[5:00-6:00] CONNECTION/APPLICATION
- Link to broader patterns (CCCs)
- Show real-world applications
- "This same idea shows up in..."

[6:00-6:30] CALL TO ACTION
- Invite further exploration
- Preview what comes next
- "Now it's your turn to..."
```

### Script Writing Rules

1. **Write for speaking, not reading**
   - Read it aloud as you write
   - Use contractions ("it's" not "it is")
   - Include natural pauses [PAUSE]

2. **Front-load the interesting stuff**
   - Don't save the cool part for the end
   - Hook them in the first 10 seconds

3. **Use the "So what?" test**
   - After every fact, ask "Why should they care?"
   - If you can't answer, reframe or cut it

4. **Include visual cues**
   - [SHOW: diagram of water cycle]
   - [ANIMATION: molecules moving]
   - [CUT TO: student experiment]

5. **Build in interaction**
   - "Pause and think: what do YOU think happens?"
   - "Try this: look around the room and find..."

### Sample Script Excerpt

```
[HOOK]
HOST: Okay, quick question. [PAUSE] What did you have for
breakfast this morning?

[BEAT]

Whatever it was—cereal, eggs, toast, nothing because you were
running late [WINK]—here's a mind-blowing fact: some of the
atoms in that food? They used to be inside a dinosaur.

[SHOW: animated atoms moving through time]

I'm serious. The same carbon atoms that built a T-Rex's muscles
65 million years ago are now building YOUR muscles.

[PAUSE]

How is that possible?

[TRANSITION]

Welcome to the world of matter cycling—where nothing new gets
created, and nothing old disappears. It just keeps going around
and around and around...

[SHOW: cycling animation]

Let's figure out how this works.
```

## PowerPoint Guidelines

### Student-Facing Slides

#### Design Principles
- **One idea per slide** — Never crowd
- **Visual first** — Image takes 70%+ of space
- **Minimal text** — Max 10 words per slide
- **High contrast** — Easy to read from back of room
- **Consistent style** — Use design system colors/fonts

#### Slide Types

| Type | Purpose | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Hook Slide** | Grab attention | Single image + question |
| **Phenomenon Slide** | Present observation | Image/video + "What do you notice?" |
| **Model Slide** | Show system/relationships | Diagram with labeled parts |
| **Data Slide** | Present evidence | Simple graph + guiding question |
| **Connection Slide** | Link to big ideas | "This is like..." comparison |
| **Action Slide** | Student task | Clear instruction + visual |

#### Text Formatting
- **Headlines:** Bold, 32-44pt
- **Body:** Regular, 24-28pt
- **No paragraphs** — Use bullets or single phrases
- **Action verbs** — "Predict," "Observe," "Explain"

### Teacher-Facing Slides (Notes View)

Include detailed speaker notes with:
- What to say (scripted if helpful)
- Time estimate for this section
- Common student responses to anticipate
- Differentiation tips
- Transition cues

## Language Examples

### Student-Facing: Same Concept, Different Grades

**Concept:** Systems have parts that work together

| Grade | Language |
|-------|----------|
| **PreK-2** | "A system is like a team! All the parts work together to do something." |
| **3-5** | "A system is a group of parts that interact with each other. When one part changes, it can affect the other parts." |
| **6-8** | "Systems are made of components that interact in predictable ways. Understanding these interactions helps us predict how the whole system will behave." |
| **9-12** | "Complex systems exhibit emergent properties that arise from the interactions of components. These properties cannot be predicted by studying components in isolation." |

### Teacher-Facing: Unpacking Complex Ideas

**Complex Idea:** "Students should engage in argumentation from evidence"

**Teacher-Friendly Translation:**
> Students don't just share opinions—they make claims and back them up with evidence from their observations, data, or research. When other students disagree, they discuss the evidence, not just say "I think you're wrong."

**What This Looks Like in the Classroom:**
> - Student A: "I think the plant will grow taller with more water."
> - Teacher: "What evidence supports that claim?"
> - Student A: "Our data shows plants in group B got 2x water and grew 3 cm taller."
> - Student B: "But group B also got more sunlight. Maybe that's why."
> - Teacher: "Good thinking! How could we figure out which factor mattered more?"
