## Why This Research Matters for ModelIt K12

### Scientific Credibility
Dr. Helikar's 130+ peer-reviewed publications demonstrate that Boolean network modeling is a legitimate, powerful approach to understanding biological systems. This isn't a simplification for students—it's the same methodology used in cutting-edge research.

### Educational Foundation
The education research papers show evidence-based approaches to teaching systems thinking through computational modeling, validating the pedagogical approach.

### Platform Lineage
The Cell Collective platform evolved into ModelIt K12, meaning students are using a research-grade tool adapted for education, not a watered-down simulation.

### Standards Compliance
Dr. Helikar's work on SBML and other standards ensures that models created in ModelIt are scientifically valid and interoperable with professional research tools.
