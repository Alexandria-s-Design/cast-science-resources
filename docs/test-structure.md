# CAST Test Structure

Comprehensive reference for the California Science Test (CAST) format, logistics, and administration.

---

## Overview

The CAST is a **computer-based, fixed-form** science assessment administered as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) system. Unlike the Smarter Balanced ELA and Math tests (which are computer-adaptive), the CAST uses a **linear test design**.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Assessment type** | Summative, fixed-form (not computer-adaptive) |
| **Delivery** | Computer-based via secure browser |
| **Alignment** | California Next Generation Science Standards (CA NGSS) |
| **Three dimensions** | Science & Engineering Practices (SEPs), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs) |
| **First operational year** | 2018–19 |
| **Total items per test** | 44–60 items (varies by grade level) |

---

## Grade Levels and Timing

| Grade Level | Grade Span Assessed | Segments | Total Items | Estimated Duration |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Grade 5** | Grades 3–5 PEs (45 PEs) | 6 + survey | 44–60 | ~2 hours (untimed) |
| **Grade 8** | Grades 6–8 PEs (59 PEs) | 6 + survey | 44–60 | ~2 hours (untimed) |
| **High School** | HS PEs | 6 + survey | 44–60 | ~2 hours (untimed) |

### Important Timing Notes
- The CAST is **untimed** — students are given as much time as they need
- Each of the first five segments averages approximately **20 minutes**
- Testing can be paused and resumed across multiple days within the school's testing window
- A **Student Survey** follows the test (3 questions for Gr 5/8; 4 for HS)

---

## Testing Window

### 2025–26 Administration
- **State window:** February 24 – June 2, 2026
- **Earliest possible start:** January 20, 2026
- **Minimum requirement:** Each testing window must contain at least **25 instructional days**
- Districts set their own specific dates within the state window
- Make-up testing is allowed within the window

### Grades Tested
- **Grade 5** — summative
- **Grade 8** — summative
- **High School** — once (grade 10, 11, or 12 as determined by the LEA/district)

## Test Format

### Segment Structure

Each grade level has **6 content segments plus a student survey**:

| Segment Group | Segments | Content | Item Types |
|---------------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Segment A** | 1, 2, 3 | Discrete (stand-alone) items | SR, CR, Table Fill-In, Graphing |
| **Segment B** | 4, 5, 6 | Performance Tasks (PTs) | Multi-item clusters around a single phenomenon |
| **Survey** | — | Student experience questions | 3–4 questions |

- **Segment A** items are individual questions not grouped around a single phenomenon
- **Segment B** contains at least one Performance Task from **each** of the three science domains (PS, LS, ESS)
- Each PT is a cluster of **4–6 items** built around a single observable science phenomenon

### Item Types

| Item Type | Description | Scoring |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Selected Response (SR)** | Multiple-choice or multi-select items | Machine-scored |
| **Constructed Response (CR)** | Open-ended written responses requiring scientific reasoning | 2 points; hand-scored by educators |
| **Table Fill-In** | Students complete data tables | Machine-scored |
| **Graphing** | Students create or manipulate graphs | Machine-scored |
| **Performance Tasks (PTs)** | Multi-part scenarios (4–6 items) around a science phenomenon; assess 2–3 PEs within a single domain; include at least one CR item | Mixed scoring |

### Three-Dimensional Assessment

Each item or task assesses students on **all three dimensions simultaneously**:

1. **Science and Engineering Practice (SEP)** — the skill being demonstrated
2. **Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI)** — the content knowledge applied
3. **Crosscutting Concept (CCC)** — the connecting theme or lens

This means items are not simple factual recall — they require students to *apply* practices to *content* through the lens of *crosscutting concepts*.

---

## Domains and Reporting Categories

The CAST assesses three core science domains. Engineering (ETS) is **integrated** into the other three domains rather than assessed as a standalone section. Each student receives at least one Performance Task from each domain.

### Grade 5

| Domain | Abbreviation | Approximate % of Test |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Physical Science | PS | ~25% |
| Life Science | LS | ~30% |
| Earth and Space Science | ESS | ~30% |
| Engineering (integrated) | ETS | ~15% |

### Grade 8

| Domain | Abbreviation | Approximate % of Test |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Physical Science | PS | ~30% |
| Life Science | LS | ~30% |
| Earth and Space Science | ESS | ~25% |
| Engineering (integrated) | ETS | ~15% |

> **Note:** Percentages are approximate. The [CAST Blueprint](../pdfs/CAST-Blueprint.pdf) provides the authoritative domain weights.

## Scoring

### Achievement Levels

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | **Standard Exceeded** | Demonstrates thorough understanding of CA NGSS |
| 3 | **Standard Met** | Demonstrates adequate understanding |
| 2 | **Standard Nearly Met** | Demonstrates partial understanding |
| 1 | **Standard Not Met** | Demonstrates minimal understanding |

### Scale Score Ranges

| Grade | Level 1 (Not Met) | Level 2 (Nearly Met) | Level 3 (Met) | Level 4 (Exceeded) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Grade 5** | 150–178 | 179–213 | 214–230 | 231–250 |
| **Grade 8** | 350–377 | 378–414 | 415–432 | 433–450 |
| **High School** | 550–575 | 576–614 | 615–635 | 636–650 |

### Score Reporting

- **Overall scale score** — a single numeric score per student
- **Achievement level** — one of the four levels above
- **Domain-level performance** — relative strengths/weaknesses by domain
- Scores are reported at **student, school, district, county, and state** levels
- Results are available on the [CAASPP reporting site](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/)
- Statewide, approximately **31% of students** meet or exceed the standard on CAST

### Constructed Response Scoring

- Worth **2 points** each
- **Hand-scored by educators** (not machine-scored)
- Rubrics assess the **quality of reasoning and evidence**, not just correctness
- Exemplar scored responses are published by CDE (see [scoring guide PDFs](../pdfs/))
