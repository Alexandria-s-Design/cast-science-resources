# CAST Test Structure

Comprehensive reference for the California Science Test (CAST) format, logistics, and administration.

---

## Overview

The CAST is a **computer-based, fixed-form** science assessment administered as part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) system. It was developed by Educational Testing Service (ETS) in partnership with the California Department of Education (CDE).

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Assessment type** | Summative, fixed-form (not computer-adaptive) |
| **Delivery** | Computer-based via secure browser |
| **Alignment** | California Next Generation Science Standards (CA NGSS) |
| **Three dimensions** | Science & Engineering Practices (SEPs), Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs) |
| **First operational year** | 2018–19 |
| **Developer** | ETS (Educational Testing Service) |

## Grade Levels and Timing

| Grade Level | Grade Span Assessed | Segments | Estimated Duration | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|--------------------|-------|
| **Grade 5** | Grades 3–5 PEs | 2 | ~2 hours | Untimed; most students finish in 1.5–2 hours |
| **Grade 8** | Grades 6–8 PEs | 2 | ~2 hours | Untimed; most students finish in 1.5–2 hours |
| **High School** | HS PEs | 2 | ~2 hours | Typically administered in Grade 11 or 12 |

### Important Timing Notes
- The CAST is **untimed** — students are given as much time as they need
- Schools typically schedule **two sessions** (one per segment) on the same or different days
- Each segment takes approximately **45–60 minutes** for most students
- There is a **mandatory break** between segments

---

## Testing Window

CAST is administered during a **spring testing window** set by the CDE each year:

- **Typical window:** Mid-March through mid-June
- **Exact dates** are set by each Local Education Agency (LEA) / district
- Districts have flexibility within the state window
- Make-up testing is allowed within the window

## Test Format

### Segments

Each grade level has **2 segments**:

| Segment | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Segment 1** | Mix of performance tasks (PTs) and discrete items |
| **Segment 2** | Mix of performance tasks (PTs) and discrete items |

Students must complete Segment 1 before beginning Segment 2.

### Item Types

| Item Type | Description | Typical Count |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Performance Tasks (PTs)** | Multi-part scenarios requiring extended reasoning; include simulations, data analysis, modeling | 2–4 per test |
| **Discrete Items** | Standalone items; shorter than PTs | 20–30 per test |
| **Constructed Response (CR)** | Open-ended written responses scored with rubrics | 3–6 per test |
| **Selected Response (SR)** | Multiple-choice or multi-select | Most common discrete type |
| **Technology-Enhanced (TE)** | Drag-and-drop, simulations, graphing, sorting, matching, hot spots | Integrated throughout |

### Three-Dimensional Assessment

Each item or task assesses students on **all three dimensions simultaneously**:

1. **Science and Engineering Practice (SEP)** — the skill being demonstrated
2. **Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI)** — the content knowledge applied
3. **Crosscutting Concept (CCC)** — the connecting theme or lens

This means items are not simple factual recall — they require students to *apply* practices to *content* through the lens of *crosscutting concepts*.

## Domains and Reporting Categories

### Grade 5

| Domain | Abbreviation | Approximate % of Test |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Physical Science | PS | ~25% |
| Life Science | LS | ~30% |
| Earth and Space Science | ESS | ~30% |
| Engineering, Technology & Applications | ETS | ~15% |

### Grade 8

| Domain | Abbreviation | Approximate % of Test |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Physical Science | PS | ~30% |
| Life Science | LS | ~30% |
| Earth and Space Science | ESS | ~25% |
| Engineering, Technology & Applications | ETS | ~15% |

> **Note:** Percentages are approximate. The CAST Blueprint provides the authoritative domain weights.

## Scoring

### Achievement Levels

| Level | Code | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Standard Exceeded** | 4 | Demonstrates thorough understanding of CA NGSS |
| **Standard Met** | 3 | Demonstrates adequate understanding |
| **Standard Nearly Met** | 2 | Demonstrates partial understanding |
| **Standard Not Met** | 1 | Demonstrates minimal understanding |

### Score Reporting

- **Overall scale score** — a single numeric score per student
- **Achievement level** — one of the four levels above
- **Domain-level performance** — relative strengths/weaknesses by domain
- Scores are reported at **student, school, district, county, and state** levels
- Results are available on the [CAASPP reporting site](https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/)

### Constructed Response Scoring

- Scored using **rubrics** (typically 0–3 or 0–4 point scales)
- Rubrics assess the **quality of reasoning and evidence**, not just correctness
- Human scoring with AI-assisted second scoring for reliability
- Exemplar scored responses are published by CDE (see PDFs)
