## Preparation Strategy

### For Students
1. Start with **CAASPP Training Tests** to learn the interface
2. Take **CAASPP Practice Tests** to experience real item types
3. Review **Constructed Response Exemplars** to understand scoring expectations
4. Use **Item Specifications** to understand what each PE requires

### For Teachers
1. Use **Interim Assessments** (through TOMS) for formative data
2. Reference **Item Specifications** when creating classroom assessments
3. Use **Scoring Guides** to calibrate CR scoring
4. Align instruction to the **three-dimensional** assessment approach (SEP + DCI + CCC)
