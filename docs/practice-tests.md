## Official CAASPP Practice & Training Tests

The most important preparation resource. These use the **same testing platform** as the real CAST.

### How to Access (No Login Required)
1. Go to the **Student Testing Portal**: https://capt.cambiumtds.com/student/?a=Student
2. Select **"Continue as Guest"** then **"Guest Session"**
3. Select the grade level
4. Choose **"California Science Test"** as the test type
5. Select either **"Practice Test"** or **"Training Test"**

| Resource | Grade Levels | URL |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Practice Tests** | Grade 5, 8, HS | [CAASPP Practice Tests](https://www.caaspp-elpac.org/resources/preparation/practice-and-training-tests) |
| **Training Tests** | Grade 5, 8, HS | Same link above — Training Tests tab |
| **Interim Assessments** | Varies | Available through TOMS (requires educator login) |

### Practice Test Features
- **No login required** — anyone can access

- Include **all item types**: Selected Response, Constructed Response, Table Fill-In, Graphing, Performance Tasks
- Use the **same secure browser interface** as the real test
- Available in **English and Spanish**
- Include **three Performance Tasks** (one per science domain: PS, LS, ESS)

### Interim Assessment Blocks (IABs) — Educator Access Only

- **Grades 3–5:** Each IAB assesses all three science domains in one test
- **MS & HS:** Three separate IABs, each assessing a single science domain
- **Structure:** Two segments per IAB (discrete items + performance task)
- **Lookup Tool:** [IA Lookup](https://www.caaspp-elpac.org/assessments/interim/caaspp-and-elpac/interim-assessment-lookup)

## Preparation Strategy

### For Students
1. Start with **CAASPP Training Tests** to learn the interface
2. Take **CAASPP Practice Tests** to experience real item types
3. Review **Constructed Response Exemplars** to understand scoring expectations
4. Use **Item Specifications** to understand what each PE requires
5. Practice with **PhET Simulations** and **Khan Academy** for content reinforcement

### For Teachers
1. Use **Interim Assessments** (through TOMS) for formative data
2. Reference **Item Specifications** when creating classroom assessments
3. Use **Scoring Guides** to calibrate CR scoring
4. Align instruction to the **three-dimensional** assessment approach (SEP + DCI + CCC)
5. Use **Pear Assessment** or **Education4Equity** for additional practice items
