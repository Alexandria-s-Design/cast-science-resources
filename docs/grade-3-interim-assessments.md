# Grade 3 — Interim Assessments

Grade 3 students **do not take the summative CAST**. The first summative science assessment is administered at **Grade 5**. However, the CAASPP system provides **Interim Assessments (IAs)** for Grade 3 that are aligned to the CA NGSS.

## What Are Interim Assessments?

Interim Assessments are **optional, formative tools** available to California educators through the CAASPP system. They are:

- **Not high-stakes** — results are not reported publicly
- **Flexible** — can be administered at any time during the school year
- **Formative** — designed to inform instruction, not rank students
- **Computer-based** — administered through the same CAASPP testing platform
- **Free** — available at no cost to California public schools

### Types of Interim Assessments

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Interim Comprehensive Assessment (ICA)** | Mirrors the full summative test in scope and format; covers all domains |
| **Interim Assessment Blocks (IABs)** | Shorter, focused assessments targeting specific topics or PE clusters |

## Grade 3 CA NGSS Standards

### Physical Science

#### Forces and Interactions
| Code | Performance Expectation |
|------|------------------------|
| **3-PS2-1** | Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object. |
| **3-PS2-2** | Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion. |
| **3-PS2-3** | Ask questions to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each other. |
| **3-PS2-4** | Define a simple design problem that can be solved by applying scientific ideas about magnets. |

### Life Science

#### Inheritance and Variation of Traits / Life Cycles
| Code | Performance Expectation |
|------|------------------------|
| **3-LS1-1** | Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death. |
| **3-LS3-1** | Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited from parents and that variation of these traits exists in a group of similar organisms. |
| **3-LS3-2** | Use evidence to support the explanation that traits can be influenced by the environment. |

#### Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems
| Code | Performance Expectation |
|------|------------------------|
| **3-LS2-1** | Construct an argument that some animals form groups that help members survive. |
| **3-LS4-1** | Analyze and interpret data from fossils to provide evidence of the organisms and the environments in which they lived long ago. |
| **3-LS4-2** | Use evidence to construct an explanation for how the variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing. |
| **3-LS4-3** | Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all. |
| **3-LS4-4** | Make a claim about the merit of a solution to a problem caused when the environment changes and the types of plants and animals that live there may change. |

### Earth and Space Science

#### Weather and Climate
| Code | Performance Expectation |
|------|------------------------|
| **3-ESS2-1** | Represent data in tables and graphical displays to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season. |
| **3-ESS2-2** | Obtain and combine information to describe climates in different regions of the world. |
| **3-ESS3-1** | Make a claim about the merit of a design solution that reduces the impacts of a weather-related hazard. |

2. Educators can access IAs through the **CAASPP Test Operations Management System (TOMS)**
3. IAs require a CAASPP-authorized educator account

## Why Grade 3 Matters for ModelIt

Even though Grade 3 does not have a summative CAST, the standards taught in Grade 3 are **assessed on the Grade 5 CAST**. This means:

- Grade 3 instruction builds foundational knowledge for the Grade 5 assessment
- Interim assessments help teachers identify gaps before the summative test
- ModelIt simulations targeting Grade 3 standards (e.g., ecosystems, weather patterns, forces) directly support long-term CAST readiness

### High-Value Grade 3 Standards for ModelIt

| Standard | Why It Aligns |
|----------|--------------|
| 3-LS4-3 | Habitat suitability — model organism survival in different environments |
| 3-ESS2-1 | Weather patterns — model seasonal weather data |
| 3-PS2-1 | Forces and motion — simulate balanced/unbalanced forces |
| 3-LS2-1 | Group behavior — model how animal groups improve survival |
