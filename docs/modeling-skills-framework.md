## Detailed Skill Descriptions

### Skill 1: Adding/Removing Components

**What it is:** The ability to identify relevant parts of a system and add them to a model, or remove components that are not needed.

**Why it matters:** Every model begins with identifying what's IN the system. Students must decide what to include and what to leave out—a fundamental scientific modeling decision.

**LEVER Connection:** **L**ocate the System

**Student Actions:**
- Identify components from a phenomenon description
- Click/tap to add new nodes to the model canvas
- Delete components that aren't relevant
- Decide on system boundaries

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Student can add at least 3 relevant components to a model
- Student can explain why certain components were included/excluded
- Student recognizes when a component is missing

---

### Skill 2: Moving Components

**What it is:** The ability to arrange components spatially to create a clear, readable model.

**Why it matters:** Visual organization affects understanding. Well-arranged models communicate relationships more clearly and help identify patterns.

**LEVER Connection:** **V**isualize & Model

**Student Actions:**
- Drag components to logical positions
- Group related components together
- Create visual hierarchy (inputs on left, outputs on right)
- Maintain readable spacing

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Model is organized logically (not random placement)
- Related components are grouped
- Model is readable without overlapping elements

---

### Skill 3: Naming Components

**What it is:** The ability to give components clear, accurate, and descriptive names.

**Why it matters:** Good naming makes models understandable to others and helps students articulate their thinking about the system.

**LEVER Connection:** **L**ocate the System, **E**stablish Relationships

**Student Actions:**
- Use descriptive names (not "thing1" or "A")
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Use scientific vocabulary appropriately
- Rename components as understanding deepens

**Assessment Evidence:**
- All components have meaningful names
- Names reflect the scientific concept represented
- Another student could understand the model from names alone

---

### Skill 4: Adding/Removing Relationships

**What it is:** The ability to connect components with edges that represent how they influence each other.

**Why it matters:** Relationships are the heart of systems thinking. Understanding that components don't exist in isolation—they AFFECT each other—is the key insight.

**LEVER Connection:** **E**stablish Relationships

**Student Actions:**
- Draw connections between related components
- Distinguish between activation (+) and inhibition (-)
- Remove relationships that don't exist in the real system
- Recognize that not everything is connected to everything

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Relationships reflect actual cause-effect connections
- Student can explain why each relationship exists
- No spurious or unsupported relationships

---

### Skill 5: Viewing/Removing Simulation Components

**What it is:** The ability to select which components to display in simulation outputs and focus attention on relevant variables.

**Why it matters:** Real systems are complex. Scientists focus on specific variables to understand patterns. Students learn to manage complexity by controlling what they observe.

**LEVER Connection:** **V**isualize & Model, **E**valuate Outcomes

**Student Actions:**
- Select components to display on the activity graph
- Hide components that clutter the view
- Compare specific components against each other
- Focus on key variables for analysis

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Student can isolate relevant components for analysis
- Graph displays are purposeful, not random
- Student can explain why certain components were selected for viewing

---

### Skill 6: Identifying Relationships Directionality

**What it is:** The ability to determine the direction of influence between components (A affects B vs. B affects A vs. both).

**Why it matters:** Directionality reveals causation. "Sunlight affects plant growth" is different from "plant growth affects sunlight." Getting direction right is critical for accurate models.

**LEVER Connection:** **E**stablish Relationships

**Student Actions:**
- Correctly orient arrows from cause to effect
- Identify one-way vs. bidirectional relationships
- Recognize feedback loops (A → B → C → A)
- Distinguish correlation from causation

**Assessment Evidence:**
- All arrows point in the correct direction
- Student can justify the directionality of each relationship
- Feedback loops are correctly identified

---

### Skill 7: Setting/Modifying Simulation Activity Levels

**What it is:** The ability to set initial conditions for a simulation—deciding which components start ON or OFF, and at what activity level.

**Why it matters:** Initial conditions dramatically affect outcomes. Scientists test multiple scenarios by varying starting conditions. This is experimental design in a computational context.

**LEVER Connection:** **V**isualize & Model

**Student Actions:**
- Set components to ON (1) or OFF (0)
- Adjust activity levels (0-100%)
- Create multiple scenarios with different initial conditions
- Predict outcomes before running simulation

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Initial conditions are set purposefully
- Student can explain why specific initial conditions were chosen
- Multiple scenarios are tested systematically

---

### Skill 8: Identifying/Changing Dependent/Independent Variables

**What it is:** The ability to distinguish between variables you control (independent) and variables you measure (dependent).

**Why it matters:** This is fundamental to experimental design and scientific reasoning. Understanding what you're changing vs. what you're observing is essential for valid conclusions.

**LEVER Connection:** **E**valuate Outcomes

**Student Actions:**
- Identify which components are inputs (independent)
- Identify which components are outputs (dependent)
- Recognize internal vs. external components
- Design experiments by systematically varying independent variables

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Student correctly classifies variables as dependent or independent
- Experimental design changes one variable at a time
- Student can predict how changing independent variables affects dependent ones

---

### Skill 9: Identifying/Setting Component Activity/Output

**What it is:** The ability to read simulation results and understand what the activity levels and outputs mean.

**Why it matters:** Running a simulation is useless if you can't interpret the results. This skill connects computational output to real-world meaning.

**LEVER Connection:** **E**valuate Outcomes

**Student Actions:**
- Read activity graphs accurately
- Interpret what high/low activity means for each component
- Connect graph patterns to system behavior
- Translate numerical output to biological/physical meaning

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Student can accurately describe what the graph shows
- Student connects output to the real phenomenon
- Student identifies patterns (oscillation, stability, change)

---

### Skill 10: Identifying/Correcting Errors in the Model/Simulation

**What it is:** The ability to recognize when a model produces unexpected or incorrect results and diagnose what needs to be fixed.

**Why it matters:** All models are wrong; some are useful. Scientists constantly revise models based on evidence. Debugging is a core scientific practice.

**LEVER Connection:** **R**evise & Extend

**Student Actions:**
- Compare model output to expected behavior
- Identify which components or relationships might be wrong
- Systematically test changes to find errors
- Revise and re-run simulations
- Document changes and reasoning

**Assessment Evidence:**
- Student recognizes when output doesn't match expectations
- Student can propose hypotheses about what's wrong
- Student systematically tests fixes
- Student's revisions improve model accuracy
