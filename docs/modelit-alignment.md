# ModelIt K12 — CAST Alignment

This document maps [ModelIt K12](https://modelit.io)'s systems thinking and computational modeling capabilities to the California Science Test (CAST) standards framework.

## Why ModelIt Aligns with CAST

The CAST assesses students on **three dimensions simultaneously** — students must demonstrate a Science and Engineering Practice (SEP) applied to a Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI) through the lens of a Crosscutting Concept (CCC). ModelIt's simulation-based learning naturally embodies this three-dimensional approach:

1. **Students DO science** (SEPs) — they build, test, and revise models
2. **Students LEARN content** (DCIs) — through exploring system behavior
3. **Students THINK across domains** (CCCs) — systems thinking is inherently crosscutting

## Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)

The CAST emphasizes 8 SEPs. ModelIt directly supports 6 of them:

| SEP | CAST Weight | ModelIt Alignment | Strength |
|-----|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **1. Asking Questions & Defining Problems** | Medium | Students formulate questions about system behavior before building models | Strong |
| **2. Developing and Using Models** | **High** | **Core platform feature** — students build, test, and revise computational models | **Strongest** |
| **3. Planning & Carrying Out Investigations** | Medium | Virtual experiments with controlled variables in simulations | Strong |
| **4. Analyzing & Interpreting Data** | **High** | Built-in graphs, data tables, and visualization tools | **Strongest** |
| **5. Using Mathematics & Computational Thinking** | **High** | Computational modeling with variables, equations, and system dynamics | **Strongest** |
| **6. Constructing Explanations & Designing Solutions** | High | Students explain model behavior and iterate on system designs | Strong |
| 7. Engaging in Argument from Evidence | Medium | Students defend model choices using simulation output | Moderate |
| 8. Obtaining, Evaluating & Communicating Information | Low | Indirect — students communicate findings from models | Moderate |

### CAST SEP Distribution

The CAST Blueprint emphasizes **Developing and Using Models** and **Analyzing and Interpreting Data** most heavily — both are ModelIt's strongest alignment areas.

## Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)

| CCC | ModelIt Alignment | How It Shows Up |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| **1. Patterns** | Strong | Data output reveals patterns in system behavior; students identify trends |
| **2. Cause and Effect** | Strong | Students manipulate input variables and observe causal outcomes |
| **3. Scale, Proportion, and Quantity** | Moderate | Models use quantitative variables; students adjust scales |
| **4. Systems and System Models** | **Strongest** | Foundational — every ModelIt activity IS a system model |
| **5. Energy and Matter** | Strong | Stock-and-flow models track quantities (matter, energy) through systems |
| **6. Structure and Function** | Moderate | System architecture reflects how structure determines behavior |
| **7. Stability and Change** | Strong | Models show equilibrium, feedback loops, tipping points, and oscillations |

2. **Performance Task Preparation** — CAST's performance tasks require extended modeling and reasoning, exactly what ModelIt trains students to do
3. **Constructed Response Readiness** — Students who can explain model behavior can articulate scientific reasoning in written responses
4. **Data Literacy** — ModelIt's built-in graphing and data tools prepare students for CAST's data interpretation items
