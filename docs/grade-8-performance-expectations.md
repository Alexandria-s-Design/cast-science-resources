# Grade 8 — CAST Performance Expectations

The California Science Test (CAST) at Grade 8 assesses all **Performance Expectations (PEs)** from the **Grades 6–8 (Middle School) band** of the CA NGSS. California organizes middle school science using a **discipline-specific model** (not integrated):

- **Grade 6** — Earth and Space Science, Engineering
- **Grade 7** — Life Science, Engineering
- **Grade 8** — Physical Science, Engineering

However, the **CAST at Grade 8 assesses ALL middle school PEs** regardless of when they were taught.

**Total PEs: 59**
